# Baltic Sea Cable Sabotage

## Overview
A pattern of undersea cable damage in the Baltic Sea since late 2024 represents a new dimension of hybrid warfare targeting critical infrastructure. At least six incidents have been attributed to deliberate action, likely by Russia's shadow fleet. NATO launched **Operation Baltic Sentry** (January 14, 2025) in response. Undersea cables carry **95%+ of intercontinental data** and are a systemic vulnerability — approximately 600 cables worldwide with limited repair capacity.

## Incident Timeline

| Date | Cable | Vessel | Details |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| September 2022 | Nord Stream 1 & 2 | Unknown | Explosions ruptured 3 of 4 pipelines; explosive residue confirmed; German arrest warrant for Ukrainian suspect |
| October 7, 2023 | Balticconnector + telecom cables | *Newnew Polar Bear* (Hong Kong) | Gas pipeline (Finland-Estonia) severed by anchor drag; damages ~€300M; repaired after 6 months; China acknowledged responsibility, called accidental |
| November 17-18, 2024 | BCS East-West + C-Lion1 | *Yi Peng 3* (China) | Two cables cut near-simultaneously; anchor dragged ~160km; both repaired by Nov 28 |
| December 25, 2024 | EstLink 2 + 4 telecom cables | *Eagle S* (Cook Islands) | 658 MW HVDC power cable cut; reduced Finland-Estonia capacity from 1,016 MW to 358 MW; anchor dragged 66 miles over 6+ hours; crew boarded by Finnish Rapid Response Unit |
| January 26, 2025 | Latvia-Gotland fiber | *Vezhen* | Swedish prosecutors **ruled accidental** (not sabotage); vessel released Feb 3 |
| January 26 / Feb 21, 2025 | C-Lion1 (third incident) | Unknown | Damage detected Feb 21; likely occurred Jan 26; sabotage suspected; data traffic continued |

Between October 2023 and February 2025, approximately **twelve pipelines, power cables, and communications cables** were severed in the Baltic in at least four separate anchor-dragging incidents. All confirmed incidents used the same technique: vessels dragging anchors along the seabed for extended distances. Recorded Future documented **44 publicly reported submarine cable damages** in 32 groupings during 2024-2025 globally.

## Key Investigations

### Yi Peng 3
- Chinese-flagged bulk carrier owned by Ningbo Yipeng Shipping; departed Russian port of Ust-Luga November 15, 2024
- Allegedly dragged anchor ~160km through both cable routes
- Denmark could not board without Chinese consent under international maritime law — exposed critical legal gap
- December 18: China allowed German/Swedish investigators to board, with China conducting primary investigation
- Western intelligence: do not believe Chinese government was involved; suspect **Russian intelligence induced the Chinese captain** to drag anchor (reported)
- Reports reference encrypted communications relayed to Yi Peng 3 by Russian vessels on November 21 (reported)
- December 21: vessel departed on own initiative for Port Said, Egypt

### Eagle S
- Cook Islands-flagged tanker; Azerbaijan-registered owner, Dubai office, India-managed, leased to Russian oil company — **typical shadow fleet ownership structure**
- Departed Russian port of Ust-Luga before incident
- Anchor dragged 66 miles over 6+ hours; when ordered to haul up, anchor was so damaged it snapped off the chain
- Finnish Rapid Response Unit (Karhu) and Coast Guard boarded using military helicopters; crew did not resist
- **Captain and two officers charged** (August 2025) with aggravated criminal damage and aggravated interference with telecommunications

## NATO Operation Baltic Sentry

- **Launched**: January 14, 2025 at Baltic Sea NATO Allies Summit in Helsinki (Rutte, Stubb, Michal)
- **Participating nations**: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Sweden, United States
- **Assets**: SNMG1 and SNMCMG1 standing groups; HNLMS Tromp (flagship); USS Bulkeley (joined Sep 30, 2025); US P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft (deployed to Norway, Oct 2025); **20 unmanned surface vehicles** committed
- **AI surveillance**: Run from NATO Maritime Centre for Security of CUI at Northwood, UK; builds "patterns of life" in the Baltic; monitors for anomalies (direction changes, loitering, slowing near cables)
- **Reaction time target**: 30 minutes to one hour using warships, AI tracking, and F-35 jets

(per NATO, MARCOM, USNI News)

## Legal and Policy Challenges

- **UNCLOS Article 113**: Requires states to criminalize cable damage, but enforcement depends on flag state cooperation
- **Attribution gap**: Proving deliberate sabotage vs "accidental" anchor dragging is legally difficult
- **Flag state jurisdiction**: Vessels registered in third countries complicate prosecution
- **Critical gap**: No international enforcement mechanism for infrastructure protection

## EU Response

**EU Action Plan on Cable Security** (February 21, 2025):
- **EUR 540 million** additional investment (2025-2027), totaling nearly **EUR 1 billion** under current financial framework
- National undersea sensor networks (vibrations, pressure, acoustic monitoring), smart buoys, Distributed Acoustic Sensing using optical cables themselves as sensors
- Dedicated **cable repair vessel reserve fleet** with strategically positioned spare parts
- Security Toolbox of mitigating measures and priority list of **Cable Projects of European Interest**
- Coordinated risk assessments per sea basin (Baltic, Mediterranean, etc.)

**NATO institutional responses:**
- Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell (Brussels, est. Feb 2023)
- Maritime Centre for Security of CUI (Northwood, UK, est. June 2023; IOC May 2024)
- Critical Undersea Infrastructure Network (first meeting May 2024, includes industry)
- NATO-EU Structured Dialogue on resilience

## Russia's Deep-Sea Capabilities (GUGI)

Russia's Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research (GUGI / Military Unit 40056) — Russia's most secretive military directorate — operates specialized assets for deep-sea cable/infrastructure operations:

- **Yantar**: GUGI-operated "research vessel" since 2015; carries two deep submergence submarines; equipped with sonar for seabed mapping. **November 2025**: entered UK waters north of Scotland; UK Defence Secretary Healey stated it was mapping UK undersea cables; directed lasers at military pilots; discussed in UK Parliament November 20, 2025
- **Belgorod**: World's longest submarine (608 ft); hosts mini-submarines for cable operations; also carries Poseidon nuclear-capable autonomous torpedoes
- **Losharik** (AS-12): Nuclear-powered mini-sub capable of dives over 6,000m; suffered fatal fire in 2019 (14 officers killed); repair planned
- **Vice-Admiral Burilichev**: New vessel launched ~2024-2025; designed for extreme-depth operations with cable-interaction equipment

**Key distinction**: Baltic incidents have used commercial/shadow fleet vessels with low-cost anchor-dragging (deniable hybrid warfare), not GUGI's sophisticated deep-water capabilities. GUGI represents the high-end wartime threat; anchor-dragging is the gray zone approach.

## Beyond the Baltic

### Red Sea (February 2024)
UK-owned vessel struck by Houthi missile sank, with its anchor damaging the AAE-1, EIG, and SEACOM cables — disrupting approximately **25% of traffic between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East**. Subsequent cuts to SMW4 and IMEWE cables near Jeddah under investigation.

### Taiwan
- **2023**: Chinese ships damaged cables connecting Taiwan to Matsu islands, causing internet blackout
- **January 2025**: Tanzania-flagged vessel (Hong Kong company, Chinese crew) disabled tracking, dragged anchor over cable severing Taiwan-Asia-US link
- **February 2025**: Togo-flagged *Hongtai 58* (crewed by eight Chinese nationals) damaged TPKM-3 cable connecting Taiwan to Penghu Islands. **Captain convicted and sentenced to three years.** Taiwan views these as Chinese "gray zone" tactics.

Per Jamestown Foundation: evidence of potential **Sino-Russian collaboration** on undersea sabotage operations.

## Vulnerability

- **600+ undersea cables** carry 95%+ of intercontinental data and $10+ trillion in daily financial transactions
- Limited global cable repair ship capacity (~60 vessels worldwide)
- Average repair time: 2-4 weeks per cable
- Redundancy varies significantly by region — Baltic particularly exposed
