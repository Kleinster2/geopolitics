# The Hague Summit (June 2025)

## Overview
NATO Summit held June 24-25, 2025 in The Hague, Netherlands. Principal outcome was the historic agreement for all NATO members (except Spain) to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035—a major increase from the previous 2% target.

## Key Facts
- **Date**: June 24-25, 2025
- **Location**: The Hague, Netherlands
- **Outcome**: 5% GDP defense spending commitment by 2035
- **Exception**: Spain (capped at 2.1%)

## The 5% Commitment

### Spending Breakdown
| Category | Percentage | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Core defense | 3.5% GDP | Military forces, equipment, operations |
| Defense-related | 1.5% GDP | Infrastructure, industry, resilience, innovation |

### Key Provisions
- Progress review scheduled for 2029
- Contributions to Ukraine's defense count toward 5% goal
- Allies committed €35+ billion in security assistance to Ukraine

### Historical Context
- Previous target: 2% of GDP (set at 2014 Wales Summit)
- 2024: 23 allies met 2% target (up from 3 in 2014)
- Secretary General Rutte expected all allies to meet 2% in 2025

## Spain's Objection
Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez rejected the 5% mandate, calling it "unreasonable and counterproductive." Spain will cap defense spending at 2.1% of GDP, citing fiscal and social spending concerns.

## US Response
White House credited Trump with securing "monumental victory for the United States and its allies" by "brokering an historic deal to dramatically increase defense contributions."

## Significance

### For NATO
- Largest spending increase in alliance history
- Addresses long-standing US complaints about burden-sharing
- Responds to Russian threat demonstrated in Ukraine

### For Europe
- Signals European commitment to own defense
- Germany leading with €500B commitment
- Major fiscal challenge for many members

### Challenges
- Many allies far from 5% currently
- Economic constraints in several countries
- Spain's exemption may encourage others to seek exceptions
- 2035 deadline is 10 years away

## Note on Date Confusion
Victoria Coates (Heritage) stated on Compass Points (January 2026) that the summit was in April. This is incorrect—official NATO sources confirm **June 24-25, 2025**.
