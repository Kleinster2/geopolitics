# Northwood Declaration

## Overview
Landmark UK-France nuclear cooperation agreement signed July 10, 2025 at Northwood Headquarters (UK). First explicit commitment to "coordinate" nuclear deterrence between the two European nuclear powers. Establishes framework for potential European nuclear umbrella as confidence in US extended deterrence wavers under Trump 2.0.

## Key Facts

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Signed | July 10, 2025 |
| Location | Northwood Headquarters, UK |
| Signatories | PM Keir Starmer, President Emmanuel Macron |
| Governance | UK-France Nuclear Steering Group |
| First meeting | December 10, 2025 (Paris) |

## Three Core Commitments

### 1. Deterrence Purpose
French and British nuclear weapons "exist to deter the most extreme threats to the security of our nations and our vital interests."

Forces remain **independent** but can be **coordinated**.

### 2. European Security Guarantee
> "France and the United Kingdom agree that there is no extreme threat to Europe that would not prompt a response by our two nations."

This is the key commitment - implicitly extending nuclear umbrella to Europe.

### 3. Governance Structure
Nuclear Steering Group provides political direction across:
- Nuclear policy
- Capabilities
- Operations

Led by Presidency of French Republic and UK Cabinet Office.

## Significance

### Historical First
- First time "coordination" explicitly mentioned between UK-France nuclear forces
- Goes beyond Lancaster House Treaties (2010)
- IISS: "Most far-reaching step yet in UK-France nuclear cooperation"

### Context: US Reliability Crisis
- Trump administration undermined extended deterrence credibility
- European doubt whether US would defend allies in nuclear scenario
- Per Augusto Teixeira (UFPB): US umbrella now "torn"
- Northwood provides European backstop

### Limitations
- Neither UK nor France has nuclear triad
- Combined arsenals small vs. Russia (~500 total vs. ~6,000)
- No proven answer to Russian hypersonics
- Political will untested

## Expansion Talks (2026)

### Germany
- Chancellor Friedrich Merz in discussions with UK/France (February 2026)
- Spokesman Stefan Cornelius: "Negotiations... at a very early stage"
- Historic shift for Germany given WWII legacy

### Sweden
- PM Ulf Kristersson confirmed talks with UK/France (January 2026)
- UK government confirmed Starmer discussed proposal with Kristersson
- Sweden recently joined NATO (2024)

### Potential Framework
If Germany and Sweden join arrangement:
- Significant European security architecture shift
- Less dependence on US extended deterrence
- But still relies on UK/France credibility

## Related Context

### Builds On
- **Lancaster House Treaties (2010)**: UK-France defense cooperation, joint facilities
- **NATO nuclear sharing**: Existing B61 arrangements
- **Brexit**: UK seeking European security role outside EU

### Responding To
- [[New START Expiration]] - Arms control collapse
- Trump skepticism of alliance commitments
- Russian nuclear coercion in Ukraine
- [[European Nuclear Debate]] - Ongoing discussions
