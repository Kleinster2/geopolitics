# Iran-Israel Shadow War

## Overview
Decades-long covert conflict between Iran and Israel fought through assassinations, sabotage, cyber attacks, and proxy warfare. Occasionally breaks into direct confrontation. Escalated dramatically in 2024 with unprecedented direct attacks between the two states.

## Nature of Conflict

### Existential Framing
- **Iran**: Israel as "illegitimate Zionist entity" to be destroyed
- **Israel**: Iranian nuclear program as existential threat
- Both view the other as implacable enemy
- No diplomatic relations since 1979

### Shadow War Characteristics
- Plausible deniability (mostly)
- Below war threshold
- Proxy utilization
- Assassinations and sabotage
- Cyber operations
- Occasional direct strikes

## Theaters of Operation

### Syria
- Israel strikes Iranian/Hezbollah targets
- Hundreds of strikes since 2013
- "Campaign Between Wars"
- Prevent weapons transfers
- Degrade Iranian presence

### Lebanon
- Hezbollah as primary front
- Israeli surveillance
- Periodic conflicts (2006)
- Assassination operations

### Iran Itself
- Nuclear scientist assassinations
- Sabotage operations
- Cyber attacks
- Intelligence operations

### High Seas
- Ship attacks (Iranian/Israeli-linked)
- Shadow naval warfare
- Persian Gulf incidents
- Mediterranean operations

### Global
- Attacks on Iranian/Israeli targets worldwide
