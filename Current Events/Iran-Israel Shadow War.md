# Iran-Israel Shadow War

## Overview
Decades-long covert conflict between Iran and Israel fought through assassinations, sabotage, cyber attacks, and proxy warfare. Occasionally breaks into direct confrontation. Escalated dramatically in 2024 with unprecedented direct attacks between the two states.

## Nature of Conflict

### Existential Framing
- **Iran**: Israel as "illegitimate Zionist entity" to be destroyed
- **Israel**: Iranian nuclear program as existential threat
- Both view the other as implacable enemy
- No diplomatic relations since 1979

### Shadow War Characteristics
- Plausible deniability (mostly)
- Below war threshold
- Proxy utilization
- Assassinations and sabotage
- Cyber operations
- Occasional direct strikes

## Theaters of Operation

### Syria
- Israel strikes Iranian/Hezbollah targets
- Hundreds of strikes since 2013
- "Campaign Between Wars"
- Prevent weapons transfers
- Degrade Iranian presence

### Lebanon
- Hezbollah as primary front
- Israeli surveillance
- Periodic conflicts (2006)
- Assassination operations

### Iran Itself
- Nuclear scientist assassinations
- Sabotage operations
- Cyber attacks
- Intelligence operations

### High Seas
- Ship attacks (Iranian/Israeli-linked)
- Shadow naval warfare
- Persian Gulf incidents
- Mediterranean operations

### Global
- Attacks on Iranian/Israeli targets worldwide

## 2024 Escalation

## 2025: Full-Scale War

### Failed Diplomacy (April-June 2025)
- Trump sends letter to Khamenei proposing nuclear talks
- April 12: Direct US-Iran negotiations begin
- 60-day deadline set
- Deadline passes without agreement

### June 2025: Israel's 12-Day Attack
- Beginning June 13, 2025: Israel launches comprehensive strikes
- **US participation**: Joint US-Israel operations
- **Targets**: Nuclear facilities, military infrastructure
- **Leadership decapitation**: Multiple senior IRGC commanders killed
- **Air defenses**: Destroyed, leaving Iran exposed
- Goal: Prevent nuclear weapons development

### US Strikes on Nuclear Facilities
- US directly strikes Iranian nuclear sites
- **B-2 stealth bombers** used (confirmed)
- First direct US military action against Iran's nuclear program
- Significant damage to enrichment capacity
- Washington Week (Jan 2026): "took out 3 nuclear sites"

### Results
- IRGC leadership decimated
- Nuclear program set back
- Air defense capability destroyed
- Regime severely weakened
- Set stage for [[Iran Protests 2025-2026]]

## 2026: Current Status

### Israel's Posture
- Waiting quietly as protests unfold
- Giving Trump space to decide next moves
- Netanyahu: Will not allow Iran to rebuild missiles or nuclear program
- Prepared to strike again if Iran reconstitutes

### US-Israel Coordination
- Trump administration sees weakened Iran as opportunity
- Abraham Accords expansion as regional strategy
- Continued containment of Iran
- Trump has threatened military intervention if crackdown continues

## Rules of Engagement (Evolving)

### Traditional Red Lines
- No direct state-on-state attacks
- Proportional responses
- Geographic limitations
- Avoid full war

### Eroding Rules
- Direct attacks normalized (2024)
- Leadership targeting accepted
- Geographic expansion
- Escalation spiral risk
