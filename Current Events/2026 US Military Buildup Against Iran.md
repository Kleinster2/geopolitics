# 2026 US Military Buildup Against Iran

Starting January 26, 2026, the [[United States]] deployed its largest naval and air force concentration in the [[Middle East]] since the Middle Eastern crisis began in 2023. The buildup is part of the [[2026 Iran-United States Crisis]], linked to the [[Iran Protests 2025-2026]] and subsequent regime massacres of civilians.

## Context

Tensions escalated in late 2025 as [[Iran]]'s security forces massacred thousands of civilian protesters. President [[Donald Trump]] told protesters to "keep protesting" and that "help is on its way." German Chancellor [[Friedrich Merz]] suggested Iran's leadership is in its "final days and weeks." IDF Chief of Staff [[Eyal Zamir]] estimated war would begin within 2 weeks to 2 months. [[Reza Pahlavi]], son of Iran's last Shah, publicly called for targeted military strikes against the regime.

Trump stated on February 19 that whether a deal is possible will be clear "within 10 days" (reported, Guardian).

## Force Disposition (as of February 17, 2026)

### Carrier Strike Groups

**Abraham Lincoln CSG** (Arabian Sea):
- USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) — nuclear-powered aircraft carrier
- USS Frank E. Petersen Jr. — guided-missile destroyer
- USS Spruance (DDG-111) — guided-missile destroyer
- USS Michael Murphy — guided-missile destroyer
- Nine squadrons including F-35C Lightning II, F/A-18E Super Hornets, EA-18G Growlers, E-2 Hawkeyes

**Gerald R. Ford CSG** (on deployment, moving toward region):
- USS Gerald R. Ford — nuclear-powered aircraft carrier
- USS Winston S. Churchill — guided-missile destroyer
- USS Bainbridge — guided-missile destroyer
- USS Mahan — guided-missile destroyer

### Additional Naval Assets

| Ship | Location |
|------|----------|
| USS Roosevelt (DDG-80) | Mediterranean Sea |
| USS McFaul | Persian Gulf / Strait of Hormuz |
| USS Mitscher (DDG-57) | Persian Gulf |
| USS Delbert D. Black | Red Sea |
| Ohio-class submarine | Unknown location (confirmed) |

### Air Assets (Muwaffaq Salti Air Base, Jordan)

| Aircraft | Quantity |
|----------|---------|
| A-10 Thunderbolt | Deployed |
| F-15E Strike Eagle | 24+ (relocated from RAF Lakenheath) |
| F-35A Lightning II | 30+ |
| EA-18GA Growler | 6 |
| MC/HC-130J | 4 (2x Muwaffaq Salti, 2x Diego Garcia) |

### Other Air Deployments

| Asset | Location |
|-------|----------|
| EA-11A BACN (Battlefield Airborne Communications) | 3x, Prince Sultan AB (Saudi Arabia) |
| E-3 Sentry AWACS | 2x, RAF Mildenhall (UK) |
| RC-135 SIGINT | 1x, Chania (Greece) |
| WC-135R Nuke Sniffer | RAF Mildenhall (UK) |
| F-16 fighters | UAE and Saudi Arabia |

### Airlift (since January 16)

| Aircraft | Flights |
|----------|---------|
| C-17A Globemaster | ~160 flights |
| C-5M Super Galaxy | 18 flights (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Djibouti) |
| C-130H/J | Numerous flights |
| C-17A & C-5M (AD batteries) | 99+ flights transferring air defense systems |

### Air Defense

- THAAD: at least one additional battery (Saudi Arabia or Qatar)
- MIM-104 Patriot: multiple batteries across the region

## Scale Assessment

Per PBS/AP (February 19): this is the "largest force of American warships and aircraft to the Middle East in decades" (confirmed). Two carrier strike groups operating simultaneously in theater is rare — it signals either imminent operations or maximum-pressure coercion.

The deployment of a WC-135R "nuke sniffer" aircraft to Mildenhall is notable — this aircraft detects atmospheric nuclear signatures, suggesting intelligence concern about Iran's nuclear program status.

The Ohio-class submarine presence (confirmed but location unknown) implies nuclear deterrence signaling.

## Objectives (per US officials)

1. Deter further regime killings of protesters during the [[Iran Protests 2025-2026]]
2. Signal readiness for contingency operations (strikes on nuclear and military infrastructure)
3. Pressure Iran into nuclear negotiations — Trump's "maximum pressure" reinstated
4. Potential regime change support

## Iranian Response

Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]] warned that any confrontation could spark a wider regional war (reported). Iranian officials described the buildup as provocative. Neighboring governments warned of escalation risk.
