# Trade War 2025-2026

## Summary
Trump's second-term tariff campaign, initiated on "Liberation Day" (April 2, 2025), imposed unprecedented tariffs globally. Distinguished by volatility, frequent reversals, and use of tariffs as leverage for non-trade objectives (immigration, political outcomes). China was the only major power to fully escalate rather than negotiate.

## Liberation Day (April 2, 2025)

### What Happened
Trump announced sweeping tariffs framed as rebalancing trade:
- Applied tariffs to virtually all trading partners
- Methodology: divided trade deficit by bilateral trade volume
- "That wasn't a tariff" in technical sense (per Roberto Dumas, Insper)
- Even applied tariffs to uninhabited islands

### Critiques

**Roberto Dumas (Insper economist) analysis:**
- Tariff formula was economically nonsensical
- "Puts tariff, removes tariff, puts tariff, removes tariff"—creates massive uncertainty
- Destroys supply chains
- Contradicts stated goal of reindustrialization

**Why reindustrialization won't work (Dumas):**
- 25% steel tariff makes semi-finished steel more expensive
- One semi-finished steel worker affects 60 workers using steel as input
- Net effect: higher costs throughout manufacturing
- "Where am I going to profane comparative advantages?"
- Countries follow economic cycle: agriculture → manufacturing → services
- US already in services economy; can't go backward
- "Are you going to put a Nike factory in Detroit?"

## Country Responses

### China
- Only country to fully escalate (per Felipe Loureiro, USP)
- Went "to the last consequences" rather than accommodate
- **Rare earths countermeasure:** Restricted exports to US
- Rare earths value small (~$100 million) but critical for automotive
- Demonstrated leverage capacity
- Trump "receded significantly" after China's response

### Brazil

**Trade impact (Dumas):**
- Overall balance: $68 billion (down 8%)
- US exports: down 6%
- China exports: up 6%
- Pattern: trade diverted from US to China

**Private sector response (Maurício Moura):**
- Brazilian business lobbied White House directly
- Sectors: aviation, coffee, meat
- New paradigm: private sector circumvents diplomatic channels
- "Very large weight" in preventing worse outcomes

**Ongoing exposure:**
- 10% base tariff remains on many exports
- 40-50% aggregate tariffs on manufactures
- New threat: 25% on countries trading with Iran

### European Union

#### Turnberry Agreement (July 27, 2025)
Per [[Carlos Primo Braga]]:
- Negotiated after Liberation Day
- **Not consistent with WTO rules**
- Terms: US imposes 15% on EU imports; EU imposes 0% on US imports
- Still being analyzed by European Parliament
- **January 2026**: EU announced freezing agreement given Greenland tariff threats

#### EU Retaliation List
€93 billion in US exports targeted:
- Products: Boeing aircraft, soybeans, whiskey, motorcycles
- Selection criteria:
  1. Easy to source from non-US origins
  2. Hurts Trump's political base

**Silver lining (Braga)**: Tensions help EU-Mercosur ratification; Embraer benefits from Boeing limits

## Economic Assessment

### Won't Solve Trade Deficit (Dumas)

Twin deficits identity: if fiscal deficit increases, trade deficit will increase regardless of tariffs.

**Big Bill impact:**
- $3.5 trillion over 10 years
- Debt already 120%+ of GDP (over $38 trillion)
- Increased fiscal deficit → increased trade deficit
- "This is a macroeconomic identity"

**Historical parallel:** Reagan's 1985 Plaza Accord aimed to devalue dollar to improve trade balance. Didn't work then either—fiscal policy offset currency moves.

### Cost of Living Impact

Tariffs passed through to consumers:
- One of three factors driving Trump's 10-12 point approval decline (per Moura)
- Democratic 2025 election victories ran on cost of living messaging
- Trump attempting credit card interest rate cap as response

## Tariffs as Political Tool

Tariffs used for non-trade objectives:
- Brazil: pressure on Bolsonaro legal situation (unsuccessful)
- Brazil: big tech regulation (ongoing)
- Various: combined with sanctions, visa restrictions

## US-China Truce (January 2026)

### Current Status
- Trade truce in effect
- Potential Trump visit to Beijing in April 2026
- He Lifeng (China's economic czar/trade negotiator) meeting global CEOs at Davos

### Allies Hedging Toward China
Trump's disruptive policies pushing others to strengthen China ties:
- **Canada**: PM Carney visited Beijing (January 2026) - striking deals despite 5,525-mile US border
- **US CEOs**: Tim Cook (Apple), Jensen Huang (Nvidia) making China trips to reaffirm commitment to Chinese market
- Pattern matches Loureiro's analysis: tariff war pushing allies toward China, not away

## Strategic Implications

### Felipe Loureiro Analysis

Trump's tariff war actually **weakened** US position vs. China:
- China demonstrated countermeasures work
- Trade diverted to China (Brazil example)
- Allies pushed toward China, not away
- India placed in "very difficult situation" vs. China

### Reindustrialization Illusion

Dumas: US has "seven magnificents" (tech giants), Silicon Valley—not losing competitiveness. Manufacturing jobs left due to comparative advantage, not unfair trade. Trying to reverse economic cycle (services → manufacturing) "doesn't exist in economics."
