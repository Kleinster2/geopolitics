# US-Paraguay Status of Forces Agreement

## Overview
Signed December 15, 2025, in Washington by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Paraguayan FM Rubén Ramírez Lezcano. Establishes a legal framework for US military presence in Paraguay—a shift from episodic exercises to a structured, multi-year relationship. Part of the broader US assertion of hemispheric military primacy under the [[2026 National Defense Strategy]].

## Key Provisions
- Legal framework for US military and Department of War civilian personnel
- Facilitates bilateral/multinational training, humanitarian assistance, disaster response
- Expedited equipment transfers and real-time intelligence sharing
- US personnel granted **diplomatic-level immunity** from prosecution
- US personnel and equipment exempt from taxes and customs duties
- Officially does not envision permanent bases (per US Chargé d'Affaires Robert Alter)

## Current Deployment: 7th Special Forces Group (January-July 2026)
- US Air Force C-17 arrived with weapons and ammunition (January 12, 2026)
- **12 US instructors** (1 officer, 11 NCOs) from 7th Special Forces Group
- Training ~40 members of Paraguay's Joint Special Forces Battalion
- Training began January 19, 2026; runs through July 9, 2026
- Falls under Crisis and Contingency Response Program (congressionally authorized)
- **Five-year continuity plan** transforms this into a structured long-term relationship

## Why Paraguay

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Political alignment | Peña government reliably pro-US; one of 12 countries recognizing Taiwan over PRC |
| Low friction | Minimal domestic opposition compared to larger neighbors |
| Geographic position | Borders Bolivia (gas), Brazil, Argentina; sits on Triple Frontier |
| Strategic resources | Guarani Aquifer recharge zone; Itaipú Dam (world's 2nd-largest hydroelectric) |
| Existing infrastructure | Mariscal Estigarribia airbase can handle C-5 Galaxy; capacity for 16,000 personnel |
| Security needs | Narcotics and illicit finance in Triple Frontier |
| Signaling | Demonstrates US can build partnerships beyond traditional Colombia relationship |

## Mariscal Estigarribia Airbase
- Built 1977-1986 in the Chaco Boreal (Boquerón Department, northern Paraguay)
- Runway handles heavy military transport aircraft
- Capacity for up to 16,000 military personnel (disproportionate to local needs)
- 400 US troops stationed July 2005 - December 2006
- Both governments deny it serves as a US base; "secret base" narrative persists
- Near Bolivian border (proximity to Bolivia's natural gas reserves, Latin America's second-largest)

## Triple Frontier
Tri-border area (Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay) at the junction of the Iguazú and Paraná rivers:
- **Cities**: Puerto Iguazú (AR), Foz do Iguaçu (BR), Ciudad del Este (PY)
- Hub for narcotics trafficking, money laundering, illicit finance
- Post-9/11 US allegations of Hezbollah/Hamas fundraising (no convictions)
- Paraguay confirmed strategic agreement for **joint base** with Argentina and Brazil targeting Hezbollah-linked networks
- Near Guarani Aquifer (1.2M km² across 4 countries, one of world's largest freshwater reserves)

## Regional Reactions

**Brazil:**
- Lula concerned US soldiers could deploy along Paraguay-Brazil border (denied by Paraguay)
- Angered that Peña did not notify Brasília before signing SOFA
- Compounds tensions: Paraguay recalled ambassador to Brazil in April 2025 over Brazilian intelligence spying on Paraguayan officials
- Brazil's refusal to label PCC as "terrorists" a potential flashpoint

**Broader assessment:** Historical pattern: roughly half of countries with US SOFAs host major bases; many others see rotational deployments. Whether the official denial of permanent basing holds over five years remains to be seen.

## Connection to Venezuela and Hemisphere Strategy
- Operation Absolute Resolve (January 3, 2026) was the immediate catalyst for escalating regional exercises
- Paraguay described as "support point with low political friction and high strategic value" (Revista Sociedade Militar)
- Reporting: US expanding military exercises in Latin America post-Venezuela, with Paraguay as first partner in five-year plan
- SOUTHCOM Commander Gen. Alvin Holsey visited President Peña (August 2025) emphasizing strategic partnership
