# Global Aid Cuts

## Overview
The sharpest contraction in global aid spending in decades. The 17 largest donors are expected to cut more than **$60 billion in aid between 2023 and 2026** (per OECD/Chatham House). Led by USAID dismantlement but compounded by UK, Germany, and Canada cuts. A Lancet study (February 2, 2026) projects **9.4 million additional deaths by 2030** under the base scenario.

## The Lancet Study (February 2, 2026)

**Citation**: "Evaluating the impact of two decades of USAID interventions and projecting the effects of defunding on mortality up to 2030," *The Lancet* (PIIS0140-6736(25)01186-9).

**Institutions**: ISGlobal (Barcelona), ISC-UFBA (Brazil), UCLA, Manhica Centre.

**Key findings:**
- **Historical**: USAID programs associated with 15% reduction in all-cause mortality; estimated 91 million deaths prevented (2001-2021)
- **Base scenario**: 9.4 million additional deaths by 2030, including 2.5 million children under 5
- **Worst-case**: 22.6 million additional deaths if cuts deepen further

**Methodology note**: Peer-reviewed modeled projection using data from 133 countries. Inherently uncertain — the range between scenarios illustrates that uncertainty.

## USAID Dismantling Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| January 20, 2025 | EO "Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid" — 90-day pause on all foreign assistance |
| January 24, 2025 | Rubio issues stop-work orders on existing aid contracts |
| Early February 2025 | 10,000+ USAID employees placed on administrative leave |
| March 10, 2025 | Review conclusion: 83% of USAID programs (~5,200 contracts) cut |
| March 28, 2025 | Plans announced to merge USAID into State Department (statutory minimum of 15 positions) |

### FY2026 Budget Proposal
- Total international programs: **$31B** (47% cut from 2025 allocations of $58.8B)
- Seeks to rescind ~$20B in previously approved spending
- If both measures pass: effective **$9.6B in new money — an 84% reduction** vs. 2025
- Global health budget: $3.8B proposed (60% decrease)
- Specific eliminations: $6.2B global health, $3.2B humanitarian aid, $1.6B food assistance

## Donor Cuts

| Country | Cut Details |
|---------|-------------|
| **United States** | $68B (2024) → $32B (2025); USAID closed; 86% of portfolio terminated |
| **United Kingdom** | ODA from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI by 2027/28; FCDO bilateral aid cut GBP 600M (2025/26), rising to GBP 4.8B (2026/27); redirected to defense (2.6% GDP target) |
| **Germany** | EUR 3.5B cut for 2026 vs 2024 |
| **Canada** | CAD 2.7B cut over four years; $3.6B total Global Affairs cuts starting 2026-27 |
| **France** | Also reducing commitments |

G7 aid projected to fall to **$112 billion in 2026** — down $44 billion.

Per Chatham House (November 2025): other donors are following the US rather than filling the void.

## Impact by Sector

### PEPFAR (HIV/AIDS)
- Only ~$2.9B released of $6B appropriated for FY2025
- UNAIDS: 6.6 million additional new HIV infections and 4.2 million AIDS-related deaths (2025-2029) if programs discontinued
- HIV clinic closures in South Africa, Uganda, Kenya

### Food Aid (WFP)
- US contributed $4.5B to WFP in 2024; hundreds of millions cancelled
- WFP faces 34% budget shortfall; 25-30% staff cuts (~6,000 positions)
- $680M specifically cut from Afghanistan and Yemen

### Humanitarian Operations
- **6,700 health facilities** closed or reduced services across 22 settings
- **53 million people** cut off from healthcare access
- **233,818+ jobs lost** across 159 humanitarian agencies (by May 2025)
- 81 NGOs closed at least one office by April 2025

## Impact on Conflict Zones

- **Sudan**: IRC #1 on 2026 Emergency Watchlist; world's largest displacement
- **Gaza**: Ranked #2; infrastructure devastated, aid constrained
- **Afghanistan**: Lost ~$859M vs 2023; WFP reaching only 8% of winter target
- **Yemen**: Targeted by $680M US cut

## One-Year Assessment (February 2026)

The anniversary of the initial USAID freeze (January 20, 2025) prompted several assessments:

- **Center for Global Development**: Estimates USAID cuts alone may have led to **500,000 to 1,000,000 additional lives lost in 2025** compared to prior years (claimed, CGD)
- **The Lancet** study published February 2, 2026 (timed to anniversary)
- **Companion study** in *The Lancet Global Health* (PIIS2214-109X(26)00008-2) projected over **14 million preventable deaths** under broader scenario
- **Observed consequences at one year**: HIV clinic closures in South Africa; terminated medical programs in Afghanistan; 53 million people cut off from healthcare across 22 settings
- US funded approximately **47% of the global humanitarian appeal in 2024**; the cascading effect — with UK, Germany, Canada following rather than backfilling — compounded the original cuts
- As of June 2025, less than **17% of the $46B** needed for global humanitarian needs had been received

## China Filling the Gap

- $500M five-year WHO commitment (May 2025) — became top state donor
- Increased climate commitments
- Per Lowy Institute: "banks big wins as Trump withdraws from global aid game"
- Per Christian Science Monitor: "shrewd use of the U.S. turnabout to cement its own leadership"
