# Sudan Civil War (2023-Present)

## Overview
Catastrophic civil war between Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that erupted in April 2023. World's largest displacement crisis. Massive humanitarian catastrophe with potential for genocide. Regional implications across Horn of Africa and Sahel. Failed transition from military rule turned into devastating conflict.

## Origins

- Fragile arrangement
- International hopes

### Key Actors

- **RSF**: Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo "Hemedti"
- Both: Former partners in 2021 coup
- Rivalry over integration

### Trigger
- RSF integration into military
- Power struggle
- Timeline disputes
- April 15, 2023: Fighting erupts

## The Conflict

### Military Situation
- SAF: Air power advantage
- RSF: Ground mobility, manpower
