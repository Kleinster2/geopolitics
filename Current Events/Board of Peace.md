# Board of Peace

## Overview
Trump-proposed international body to oversee Gaza reconstruction, announced January 2026. Charter to be signed at Davos. European officials view it as attempt to create UN rival - a vehicle for Trump to "resolve other conflicts and control international events."

## Key Features

### Structure
- Trump holds ultimate decision-making power per charter
- $1 billion fee for permanent membership
- Unclear where membership payments would go
- Tony Blair appointed as executive
- Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner involved behind scenes

### Stated Purpose
- Oversee post-war Gaza redevelopment

### Perceived Purpose (European officials)
- Rival or replacement for [[United Nations]]
- Vehicle to resolve conflicts beyond Gaza
- Mechanism for Trump to control international events

## Membership Responses

### Declined/Pushed Back
| Leader | Country | Response |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Emmanuel Macron | France | Declined invitation |
| Benjamin Netanyahu | Israel | Makeup of Gaza committee "not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy" |
| Keir Starmer | UK | Declined to endorse, will consult allies |

### Conditional/Negotiating
| Leader | Country | Response |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Mark Carney | Canada | "In principle" but won't pay fee, terms need discussion |

### Accepted/Enthusiastic
| Leader | Country | Response |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Javier Milei | Argentina | Confirmed founding member |
| Giorgia Meloni | Italy | "Ready to do our part" |
| Viktor Orban | Hungary | Called invitation an "honor" |
| Mohammed VI | Morocco | Accepted |

### Invited (Response Pending)
- Alexander Lukashenko (Belarus)
- Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkey)
- Vladimir Putin (Russia) - Kremlin "aims to contact US" for details

## European Dilemma
European official: Putin invitation is "farcical" given Ukraine invasion, but confirms the dilemma - "go along with what Trump wants or risk further splitting apart the transatlantic alliance."

Europeans working to:
- Modify charter terms
- Coordinate response
- Persuade Arab nations to lobby Trump for changes

Approach encapsulates Europe's Trump 2.0 strategy: "play for time, be seen to engage, try to talk him down."

## Significance

### For International Order
- Potential UN bypass/rival
- Trump-centered decision-making vs. multilateral consensus
- Pay-to-play membership model
- Mix of democracies and autocrats (Lukashenko, potentially Putin)

### For Gaza
- Netanyahu objection suggests Israel not consulted on key details
- Qatar and Turkey officials included in Gaza committee (Israeli concern)

## Timeline
- **January 2026**: Invitations extended
- **Davos (Thursday)**: Charter signing planned
