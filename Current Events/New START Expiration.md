# New START Expiration

## Overview
The last US-Russia nuclear arms control treaty expires February 5, 2026. Russia suspended participation in February 2023; no successor has been negotiated. For the first time since 1972, the two largest nuclear arsenals will be unconstrained by any treaty.

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| April 2010 | New START signed (Prague) |
| February 2011 | Entered into force |
| February 2021 | Extended 5 years (Biden-Putin) |
| February 2023 | Russia suspends participation |
| February 5, 2026 | **Expiration** |

## What Ends

### Verification
- 18 annual on-site inspections (none since 2020)
- Biannual data exchanges
- Notifications of ICBM/SLBM movements
- Telemetry sharing

### Limits
- 1,550 deployed warheads cap
- 700 deployed delivery systems cap
- 800 total launchers cap

### Transparency
- Last window into Russian nuclear forces
- No replacement mechanism
- National technical means only

## Current Positions

### Russia
- Suspended participation (February 2023)
- Cites NATO involvement in Ukraine
- Neither side has accused the other of violating warhead limits
- **Putin proposal (September 22, 2025)**: Informally maintain treaty parameters for one more year
- Condition: Would be void if US takes steps to "undermine or disrupt the existing balance of deterrence" - specifically missile defense interceptors in space
- Trump initially said proposal "sounded like a good idea" (October 2025)
- **Trump response (January 8, 2026, NYT)**: "If [the treaty] expires, it expires. … We'll just do a better agreement."

### Medvedev Warning
Dmitri Medvedev (Vice-President, Russian Security Council):
> "This is evidence of a crisis in international relations."

### United States
- Criticized suspension as "irresponsible"
- Suspended some notifications in response
- No active negotiation for replacement
- Trump demands China inclusion in any new framework
- Pursuing [[Golden Dome]] Arctic missile defense

### China Position
- Rejects any trilateral framework
- Cites asymmetry: US/Russia control 80%+ of global nuclear warheads
- China's arsenal 6-7x smaller than either superpower
- "Why should we limit ourselves when you have so much more?"

### The Three-Way Math Problem
Per Lourival Sant'Anna (CNN Brasil, February 2026):
- US position: Need parity with Russia + China combined
- Russia response: "China is your problem, not ours"
- China response: Asymmetry means no incentive to negotiate
- Result: No format exists for three-way agreement

## Implications

### Strategic Stability
- No constraints on arsenal size
- No verification of deployments
- Modernization unchecked
- Arms race dynamics possible

### Crisis Management
- Less predictability
- No communication channels from treaty
- Miscalculation risk higher
- No transparency on new systems

### Precedent
- Completes arms control collapse
- INF (2019), Open Skies (2020), New START (2026)
- End of post-Cold War framework
- Return to pre-détente era

## What Comes Next

### Likely Scenario
- No replacement treaty
- Both sides continue modernizing
- Informal restraint possible but unverified
- Focus shifts to crisis management

### Optimistic Scenario
- Future administration restart
- Informal limits/transparency
- China eventually included
- New framework emerges

### Pessimistic Scenario
- Arsenal expansion
- New weapon types deployed
- Space/cyber/hypersonic arms race
- Nuclear multipolarity ungoverned

## Arsenal Comparison (2026 estimates)

| Category | United States | Russia |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Deployed strategic warheads | ~1,550 | ~1,550 |
| Total stockpile | ~5,500 | ~6,200 |
| ICBMs | 400 Minuteman III | ~320 (mixed) |
| SLBMs | 14 Ohio-class SSBNs | ~10 SSBNs |
| Bombers | B-52, B-2, (B-21) | Tu-95, Tu-160 |

## Analysis

### Structural Shift
The expiration marks more than a treaty ending - it closes the post-Cold War arms control era. For the first time since 1972 (SALT I), the two largest nuclear arsenals operate without any binding constraints.

### Immediate Effects (2026)
- No verification of Russian nuclear forces
- Both sides already modernizing - now unconstrained
- No treaty-based communication channel
- National technical means (satellites) only source of insight

### Strategic Stability Degradation
- "Use it or lose it" pressures increase without transparency
- New systems (hypersonics, tactical nukes) were never covered
- Crisis decision time already compressed - now less predictable
- See [[Nuclear Command and Control]] for emerging tech risks

### Arms Race Dynamics
- Neither side currently at treaty limits - quantitative race not immediate
- Qualitative race already underway (new delivery systems)
- Real risk: Russia deploys tactical nukes in Belarus/Kaliningrad without framework
- US may respond with missile defense expansion, forward deployments
- Russia has deployed three types of hypersonic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads - not covered by existing treaties

### Information Asymmetry
Per Carlos Frederico Coelho (PUC-Rio/ECEME) (CNN Brasil, February 2026): Loss of inspection regime creates dangerous information asymmetry. When you don't know what the other side is doing, the incentive is to build more weapons. The treaty had flaws - inspections hadn't happened since the pandemic - but it was better than nothing.

### Cascade Effects
- [[NPT]] bargain further eroded (NWS supposed to be disarming)
- China has no incentive to join any framework now
- Saudi Arabia, others watching - nuclear latency more attractive
- [[European Nuclear Debate]] gains urgency - can Europe rely on US umbrella?

### Extended Deterrence Crisis
Per Augusto Teixeira (UFPB, February 2026): The US nuclear umbrella over Europe is now "torn" (rasgado). Trump administration has undermined confidence in extended deterrence - both conventional and nuclear. Europeans now doubt whether US would come to their aid in a nuclear escalation scenario.

Key problem: France and UK possess nuclear weapons but neither has the nuclear triad. Their arsenals are small compared to Russia, which has the world's largest arsenal plus sophisticated delivery systems (hypersonic, multiple reentry vehicles) with no proven countermeasures.

### Leadership Factor
Per Lourival Sant'Anna: Contrasting the three leaders sitting on nuclear arsenals:
- **Xi Jinping**: "Adult in the room" - rational, predictable, reliable (despite being autocratic)
- **Putin**: "Nihilism" - sinister, destabilizing (caused largest European war since WWII)
- **Trump**: "Levity" - doesn't listen to sophisticated US national security establishment

Paradox: China is driving the arms race, but Xi is more predictable than either Trump or Putin.

### The Deeper Problem
Arms control assumed US-Russia could cooperate despite competition. Ukraine ended that premise. No treaty survives when the underlying political relationship collapses. The question now is whether any informal restraint holds, or whether the relationship deteriorates further.

## February 5, 2026: Treaty Expired

New START formally expired at midnight. For the first time since 1972, no legally binding constraints exist on the US and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals.

### Official Statements

**Russia (Kremlin, February 3-5):**
- Dmitry Peskov: "In just a few days, the world will be in a more dangerous position than it has ever been before" (Feb 3)
- Russia views expiration "negatively" and regrets its lapse
- Moscow's offer to informally observe limits for one year "remains in force" (per TASS, Feb 3)
- Russia "will be guided primarily by its national interests"

**United States (February 4-5):**
- Secretary Rubio: "didn't have any announcement" on expiration
- Rubio: Trump "has been clear that in order to have true arms control in the 21st century, it's impossible to do something that doesn't include China"
- Suggested Trump and Putin could "agree to keep current limits and then press China"
- **US never formally responded** to Putin's September 2025 informal extension proposal

**UN Secretary-General Guterres (February 5):**
- Called it "a grave moment for international peace and security"
- "For the first time in more than half a century, we face a world without any binding limits on the strategic nuclear arsenals of the Russian Federation and the United States"
- "The dissolution of decades of achievement in arms control could not come at a worse time—the risk of a nuclear weapon being used is the highest in decades"
- Urged both states "to return to the negotiating table without delay"

### Expert Reactions

**[[Rose Gottemoeller]]** (Stanford, former chief US negotiator for New START):
- Testified before Senate Armed Services Committee urging one-year renewal
- Argued Trump should "be the president of nuclear peace in this case, not Vladimir Putin"
- Warned worst-case scenario: "a rapid campaign by Russia to upload additional nuclear warheads"
- US "is not immediately ready to rush into anything"—a year's breathing room would benefit the US

**Heather Williams** (CSIS, Project on Nuclear Issues) - "Three Truths About the End of New START":
1. The end of New START does not automatically mean an arms race
2. The end of New START does not mean the US will massively build up immediately
3. The end of New START does not mean the end of arms control—may be the beginning of a new era
- But argues the moment "calls for diversifying and expanding the U.S. nuclear arsenal, paired with a new approach to arms control"

**SIPRI** (Hans M. Kristensen):
- "The era of reductions in the number of nuclear weapons in the world, which had lasted since the end of the cold war, is coming to an end"

**FDD**: Argues expiration "offers chance for US to revamp nuclear posture towards Russia and China" - frames it as opportunity rather than crisis

### China-Russia Strategic Stability Consultation (February 3)

Two days before expiration, Chinese Assistant FM Liu Bin and Russian Deputy FM Sergey Ryabkov co-chaired consultations in Beijing:
- Both sides "reached broad consensus" that "global strategic stability is facing severe challenges"
- Agreed to "strengthen strategic coordination"
- Timed deliberately to present united front before treaty expiration

### What Comes Next

**Near-term:**
- No negotiations underway or planned
- Russia's informal limits offer remains open
- Both sides continue modernization
- NPT Review Conference (April 27 - May 22, 2026) will test whether non-nuclear states demand action
- Austria circulating joint statement calling for "urgent commencement of negotiations for a successor agreement"

**Structural obstacles (unchanged):**
- US demands China inclusion
- China refuses (asymmetry argument)
- Russia demands UK/France inclusion
- No format exists for multilateral negotiation

### Macron's Expanded Deterrence (January 15, 2026)

Following emergency defence council meeting:
- Declared: "nous sommes prêts à dissuader pour défendre notre sol" (we are ready to deter to defend our territory)
- Described European territory as part of France's "vital interests"—a significant doctrinal expansion
- IISS: "unprecedented signal" that France may extend nuclear deterrent to European allies
- See [[European Nuclear Debate]] for full context

## Monitoring

### Indicators to Track
- Any diplomatic outreach on successor framework
- Arsenal announcements or testing activity
- Deployment changes (warhead uploading, new systems)
- NPT Review Conference outcome (April-May 2026)
- Whether informal restraint holds
