# Taiwan

## Overview
The most dangerous flashpoint in international politics. China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province; Taiwan functions as an independent democracy. US commitment to Taiwan's defense creates potential for great power war.

## Status Quo

### Taiwan's Position
- De facto independent since 1949
- Democratic government (ROC)
- Population: 24 million
- GDP: ~$800 billion
- No UN membership
- Global semiconductor hub (TSMC)

### China's Position (PRC)
- Taiwan is Chinese territory
- Unification is "inevitable"
- Reserves right to use force
- One China principle
- Increasing military pressure

### US Position
- One China *policy* (not principle)
- "Strategic ambiguity" on defense
- Taiwan Relations Act (1979)
- Unofficial relations
- Arms sales

## Historical Background
1. 1949: ROC retreats to Taiwan after civil war
2. 1950: Korean War → US protects Taiwan
3. 1979: US recognizes PRC, unofficial Taiwan ties
4. 1990s-2000s: Taiwan democratizes
5. 2016+: Cross-strait relations deteriorate

## Military Balance

### China (PLA)
- Massive buildup opposite Taiwan
- Amphibious assault capabilities
- Missile forces (DF-series)
- Air superiority pursuit
- Navy expansion
- Timeline: Xi's "capability by 2027"?

### Taiwan
- Defensive posture
- Asymmetric strategy shift (porcupine)
- US arms purchases
- Conscription extension
- Geographic advantages

### US Role
- Taiwan Relations Act: provide defense articles
- Increasing clarity on intervention
- Forward presence (Japan, Guam)
- Ally coordination (Japan, Australia)

## Scenarios

### Status Quo Continuation
- Current tensions persist
- No invasion, no independence declaration
- Gradual erosion of Taiwan's position?

### Coercion Short of War
- Blockade/quarantine
- Gray zone operations
- Economic pressure
- Cyber attacks

### Military Conflict
- Amphibious invasion (hardest)
- Missile strikes
- Air/sea blockade
- US intervention → great power war

## Key Variables
1. Xi Jinping's risk tolerance
2. US commitment credibility
3. Taiwan's defense posture
4. Japanese role
5. Economic interdependence
6. Domestic politics (all sides)

## Implications of Conflict
- Global economic devastation (semiconductors)
- Great power war risk
- Nuclear escalation potential
- Alliance system test
- Global order transformation

## International Positions

| Actor | Position |
|-------|----------|
| Japan | Critical concern, defense planning |
| Australia | AUKUS, ambiguous commitment |
| EU | Stability emphasis, limited role |
| ASEAN | Avoid choosing, economic ties |
