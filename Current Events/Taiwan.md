# Taiwan

## Overview
The most dangerous flashpoint in international politics. China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province; Taiwan functions as an independent democracy. US commitment to Taiwan's defense creates potential for great power war.

## Status Quo

### Taiwan's Position
- De facto independent since 1949
- Democratic government (ROC)
- Population: 24 million
- GDP: ~$800 billion
- No UN membership
- Global semiconductor hub (TSMC)

### China's Position (PRC)
- Taiwan is Chinese territory
- Unification is "inevitable"
- Reserves right to use force
- One China principle
- Increasing military pressure

### US Position
- One China *policy* (not principle)
- "Strategic ambiguity" on defense
- Taiwan Relations Act (1979)
- Unofficial relations
- Arms sales

## Historical Background
1. 1949: ROC retreats to Taiwan after civil war
2. 1950: Korean War → US protects Taiwan
3. 1979: US recognizes PRC, unofficial Taiwan ties
4. 1990s-2000s: Taiwan democratizes
5. 2016+: Cross-strait relations deteriorate

## Military Balance

### China (PLA)
- Massive buildup opposite Taiwan
- Amphibious assault capabilities
- Missile forces (DF-series)
- Air superiority pursuit
- Navy expansion
- Timeline: Xi's "capability by 2027"?

### Taiwan
- Defensive posture
- Asymmetric strategy shift (porcupine)
- US arms purchases
- Conscription extension
- Geographic advantages

### US Role
- Taiwan Relations Act: provide defense articles
- Increasing clarity on intervention
- Forward presence (Japan, Guam)
- Ally coordination (Japan, Australia)

## Scenarios

### Status Quo Continuation
- Current tensions persist
- No invasion, no independence declaration
- Gradual erosion of Taiwan's position?

### Coercion Short of War
- Blockade/quarantine
- Gray zone operations
- Economic pressure
- Cyber attacks

### Military Conflict
- Amphibious invasion (hardest)
- Missile strikes
- Air/sea blockade
- US intervention → great power war

## January 2026 Developments

### Justice Mission 2025 (Dec 29-30, 2025)
China's **largest military exercise ever** around Taiwan (6th since Pelosi visit 2022):
- 130+ aircraft sorties into Taiwan ADIZ (90 crossed median line)
- 14 warships + 8 coast guard vessels
- **First time**: Chinese military/coast guard vessels entered Taiwan's contiguous zone in significant numbers
- Rehearsed full maritime blockade: air/sea control, targeting ports, deterring external forces
- Covered larger area than any exercise since August 2022
- 850+ international flights cancelled
- Global silicon futures spiked 12%

**Trigger**: $11.1B US arms sale (record) - Beijing warned Taiwan becoming "powder keg"

### Xi's New Year Address
- Declared "national reunification is unstoppable"
- Established "Taiwan Recovery Day" - symbolic escalation

### Taiwan's Response
- President Lai pledged to defend sovereignty
- $40 billion special defense budget (2026-2033)
- "Taiwan Dome" air defense system planned
- Opposition parties blocking defense budget (6th time)

### US-Taiwan Relations Under Trump
| Development | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Trade Deal | $250B investment agreement - largest semiconductor reshoring |
| Tariffs | Reduced to 15% for Taiwan |
| Arms Sale | $11.1B package (record) |
| Policy | "Firm but calibrated" - not seeking to change status quo |

### China Counter-Sanctions
- Sanctioned 20 US military companies, 10 executives
- Targets: Northrop Grumman, L3Harris, Boeing
- Largely symbolic (minimal US defense exposure to China)

### Assessment
- Invasion in 2026 considered **unlikely** by analysts
- China perfecting "short-and-sharp" isolation tactics
- Gray-zone pressure eroding war/peace distinction
- Economic headwinds limit China's risk appetite

## Key Variables
1. Xi Jinping's risk tolerance
2. US commitment credibility
3. Taiwan's defense posture
4. Japanese role
5. Economic interdependence
6. Domestic politics (all sides)

## Implications of Conflict
- Global economic devastation (semiconductors)
- Great power war risk
- Nuclear escalation potential
- Alliance system test
- Global order transformation

## International Positions

| Actor | Position |
|-------|----------|
| Japan | Critical concern, defense planning |
| Australia | AUKUS, ambiguous commitment |
| EU | Stability emphasis, limited role |
| ASEAN | Avoid choosing, economic ties |
