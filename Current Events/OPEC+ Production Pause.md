# OPEC+ Production Pause

## Overview
Eight OPEC+ members paused planned production increases for Q1 2026 (announced November 2, 2025; reaffirmed January 4, 2026). Brent crude forecasts cluster around **$55-58/bbl** for 2026 — the highest US effective tariff rate since 1932 is suppressing global oil demand. The IEA projects a **~3.7 million bpd surplus** for 2026, driven by non-OPEC+ production growth outpacing demand. US shale has plateaued at ~13.5 million bpd.

## The Pause

Eight members (Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, Oman) froze output for January-March 2026 after a modest 137,000 bpd increase in December 2025. These members had unwound ~2.88 million bpd of voluntary cuts between April-December 2025, with 1.24 million bpd remaining. Full unwinding extended to end-2026.

## Price Forecasts (2026 Average)

| Source | Brent Forecast |
|--------|---------------|
| EIA | ~$55.87/bbl |
| J.P. Morgan | $58/bbl |
| Goldman Sachs (WTI) | $55/bbl |
| ABN AMRO | $55/bbl (declining to $50 by year-end) |

Current spot (February 5, 2026): ~$68/bbl. The gap reflects expectations of further downward pressure.

## Surplus Projection

Per IEA (January 2026 Oil Market Report):
- Demand growth: 930,000 bpd (2026)
- Supply growth: 2.5 million bpd to 108.7 million bpd
- Projected surplus: **~3.69 million bpd**
- Driven by non-OPEC+ Americas production growth

OPEC maintains forecasts pointing to a balanced market — the IEA-OPEC disagreement on demand outlook is persistent.

## New Capacity Assessment Mechanism (2026)

A significant structural development: OPEC+ launched a new mechanism to evaluate members' maximum production capacity, scheduled January-September 2026, with results feeding into 2027 quota-setting. Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman described this as helping to "stabilize markets and reward those who invest in production." This could reshape future quota allocations — potentially benefiting UAE and Kazakhstan, which have invested heavily in capacity, at the expense of members with declining fields.

OPEC+ appears to be targeting an informal Brent floor between **$62-65/bbl**, though current prices and forecasts suggest they may struggle to maintain it.

## Compliance Problems

- **Kazakhstan**: Worst offender; compensation "debt" of ~3.5 million bpd of total 4.3 million owed by all overproducers; Energy Minister acknowledged inability to meet schedules (Tengiz expansion)
- **Russia**: Required to cut additional 691,000 bpd to compensate; December output fell sharply (role of US October 2025 sanctions unclear)
- **Iraq**: Required to compensate 79,000-140,000 bpd/month

## Petrostate Fiscal Pressure

| Country | Fiscal Breakeven | Gap at $56 Brent |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Saudi Arabia | $91-96/bbl (IMF); ~$111 incl. PIF | -$35 to -$55 |
| Russia | ~$115/bbl (post-invasion) | -$59 |
| Iran | ~$140/bbl (heavily sanctioned) | -$84 |
| Iraq | ~$80/bbl | -$24 |
| UAE/Kuwait | $55-65/bbl | Near balance |

## Trade War Impact on Oil Demand

EIA revised global consumption growth forecasts downward by 400,000 bpd (2025) citing tariffs. Key channels:
- Asian demand suppression (manufacturing contraction)
- Trade volume contraction reduces transportation fuel demand
- Goldman Sachs: WTI at $55/bbl below levels sustaining aggressive US drilling
- Creates paradox for "drill, baby, drill" agenda

## US Shale Plateau

- 2025 production: ~13.42 million bpd average (record 13.5M in Q2)
- 2026 forecast (EIA): ~13.5M bpd — roughly flat; potentially first sustained decline since shale boom
- Bakken and Eagle Ford basins showing maturation signs
- ~115 rigs expected to be cut starting mid-2026
