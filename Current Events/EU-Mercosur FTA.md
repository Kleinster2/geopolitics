# EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement

## Overview
Trade agreement between the [[European Union]] and [[Mercosur]] (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay). Would create the world's largest trading zone (700 million people). After 25 years of negotiations, signed January 2026 but immediately referred to EU Court of Justice, potentially delaying implementation by two years.

## Timeline

| Date | Development |
|------|-------------|
| **2000** | Negotiations launched |
| **2004** | Talks stalled |
| **2010** | Negotiations relaunched |
| **2019** | Political agreement announced (then stalled over Amazon deforestation) |
| **July 2024** | Bolivia joins Mercosur (not included in deal) |
| **December 6, 2024** | Political agreement finalized |
| **January 9, 2026** | EU Council approved (21-5 vote) |
| **January 17, 2026** | Signed in Asuncion, Paraguay |
| **January 21, 2026** | European Parliament refers to EU Court of Justice (334-324 vote) |

## Current Status: Legal Challenge

### Court Referral (January 21, 2026)
European Parliament voted **334-324-11** to refer the deal to the Court of Justice.

**Legal questions for the Court:**
1. Was the "split deal" procedure (bypassing national parliaments) lawful?
2. Does the "rebalancing mechanism" (allowing Mercosur compensatory measures if future EU laws hurt their exports) restrict EU's ability to set environmental and health policies?

**Potential delay**: 1-2 years while Court deliberates.

### Parliament Vote Breakdown

| Political Group | Position | Notes |
|-----------------|----------|-------|
| **Greens/EFA** | For referral | Environmental concerns |
| **The Left** | For referral | Anti-corporate trade |
| **Patriots for Europe** (far-right) | For referral | Nationalist/protectionist |
| **EPP** (center-right) | Against referral | Pro-trade, internal dissent |
| **S&D** (socialists) | Against referral | Internal dissent |
| **Renew Europe** | Split | Divided along national lines |
| **ECR** (conservatives) | Free vote | No whip imposed |

**Unusual coalition**: Greens + far-left + far-right aligned against centrist establishment parties.

### The "Split Deal" Controversy

#### How EU Trade Deals Normally Work
"Mixed agreements" containing provisions affecting both EU and member state competences require approval from:
1. EU Council (member state governments)
2. European Parliament
3. All 27 national parliaments

This is why deals take years - one parliament can block everything (e.g., Wallonia blocking CETA in 2016).

#### What the Commission Did
Split EU-Mercosur into two parts:

| Part | Contents | Approval Required |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Trade agreement** | Tariffs, market access, trade rules | Council + EU Parliament only |
| **Association agreement** | Political cooperation, other elements | Council + EU Parliament + 27 national parliaments |

The Commission argued the trade portion falls under **exclusive EU competence** (per Lisbon Treaty), so national parliaments have no legal role.

#### Why Critics Object
1. **Democratic bypass**: National parliaments lose their veto - French Assemblée, Dutch Tweede Kamer, etc. cannot block it
2. **Precedent**: If successful, Commission can split future deals the same way, permanently sidelining national legislatures
3. **Rebalancing mechanism**: The deal lets Mercosur take compensatory measures if future EU laws (e.g., stricter environmental rules) hurt their exports - critics argue this restricts EU sovereignty and such questions *should* require national approval
4. **Legal ambiguity**: Whether trade provisions are truly "exclusive EU competence" or touch on shared competences (investment, services) is contested

#### The Political Reality
The Commission knew France, Austria, Ireland, and Poland would block it in their national parliaments. Splitting the deal was the only path to approval.

Critics call it a legal maneuver to circumvent democratic opposition. Supporters call it correctly using existing treaty powers.

### Farmer Protests (January 20, 2026)
Day before the vote: thousands of farmers drove tractors to Strasbourg, surrounded Parliament, clashed with police. Copa-Cogeca (EU farm lobby) backed the referral, calling the accord "divisive."

### What Happens Next
- Court ruling typically takes 1-2 years
- Commission *could* provisionally apply the deal if Council approves
- But doing so would inflame institutional tensions with Parliament

## Council Vote (January 9, 2026)

First time EU failed to back a trade agreement unanimously.

| Vote | Countries |
|------|-----------|
| **For (21)** | Qualified majority |
| **Against (5)** | Austria, France, Hungary, Ireland, Poland |
| **Abstain (1)** | Belgium |

### Opposition Reasons
- **France**: Agricultural competition concerns, environmental standards
- **Ireland**: Beef imports threatening Irish farmers
- **Austria**: Environmental and food safety concerns
- **Poland**: Agricultural sector protection
- **Hungary**: Aligned with agricultural opposition

## Scope

### Mercosur Members
- [[Argentina]] - [[Javier Milei]] strongly supportive
- [[Brazil]] - Key driver of negotiations
- Paraguay - Signing ceremony host
- Uruguay
- (Bolivia joined July 2024 but excluded from deal)

### Key Provisions
- Eliminates most tariffs on goods
- Opens services and government procurement markets
- Includes environmental and labor commitments (disputed as insufficient by critics)

## Strategic Context

### Trump Factor
Like [[EU-India FTA]], accelerated by US protectionism under Trump 2.0. EU seeking to diversify trade relationships and reduce dependence on US market access.

### Contrast with EU-India
| Aspect | EU-India | EU-Mercosur |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Negotiations | 2007-2026 (19 years) | 2000-2026 (26 years) |
| Council vote | Expected smooth | 21-5, first non-unanimous |
| Current status | Signing imminent | Court referral, 2-year delay possible |
| Main opposition | None significant | France, agricultural lobby |

### Geopolitical Significance
- EU's largest trade deal by geography
- Counters China's growing Latin American influence
- Demonstrates EU pivot to Global South
- But legal challenge shows internal EU divisions on trade policy

## Opposition

### Environmental Groups
Argue the deal:
- Accelerates Amazon deforestation
- Undermines EU Green Deal commitments
- Lacks enforceable environmental standards

### Agricultural Lobby
Concerns over:
- Beef imports from Brazil/Argentina
- Competition with European farmers
- Lower food safety standards

### Democratic Process Critics
- Deal "split" to bypass national parliaments
- Provisional application before full ratification
