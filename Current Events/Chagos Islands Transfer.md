# Chagos Islands Transfer

## Overview
UK transfer of Chagos archipelago sovereignty to Mauritius, finalized May 2025. Ends decades-long decolonization dispute while preserving US/UK military access to Diego Garcia. Trump used the deal to justify his [[Greenland Crisis|Greenland push]], calling it "an act of GREAT STUPIDITY."

## Background

### The Archipelago
- **Location**: Indian Ocean, ~1,000 miles south of India
- **Status**: Formerly British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT)
- **Key asset**: Diego Garcia - major US/UK naval and air base

### Colonial History
- 1965: UK split Chagos from Mauritius (then a colony) three years before independence
- 1960s-70s: UK forcibly removed ~2,000 Chagossians to make way for Diego Garcia base
- Human Rights Watch: displacement amounts to "crimes against humanity committed by a colonial power against an Indigenous people"
- Chagossians barred from returning for decades

### Legal Pressure
- **2019**: ICJ advisory opinion - UK occupation unlawful, should end "as rapidly as possible"
- **2019**: UN General Assembly voted 116-6 for UK to return islands
- UK courts increasingly ruling against government position
- Diego Garcia base legally threatened without resolution

## The 2024-2025 Deal

### Agreement
- **October 3, 2024**: UK announced agreement in principle
- **May 2025**: Treaty signed

### Terms
- Mauritius gains sovereignty over entire archipelago
- UK retains **99-year lease** on Diego Garcia
- Annual payment: **£101 million** (~$136M) to Mauritius
- Total value: ~£3.4 billion over lease lifetime
- Chagossians can resettle on outer islands (not Diego Garcia)

### International Support
- Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India backed the deal
- India (May 2025): "important step in completing decolonization"

## Trump's Criticism (January 2026)

On Inauguration Day (January 20, 2026), Trump attacked the deal:

> "Shockingly, our 'brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia... FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER. There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness."

### Linking to Greenland
Trump explicitly used Chagos to justify Greenland demands:
- If UK can "give away" strategic territory, why can't US acquire some?
- Framed both as questions of Western strength vs. weakness
- Called UK decision "an act of GREAT STUPIDITY"

### UK Response
> "The UK will never compromise on our national security. We acted because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future."

## Strategic Context

### Diego Garcia
- Hosts US Navy Support Facility
- B-52 bomber operations (used in Afghanistan, Iraq)
- Nuclear submarine support
- Intelligence facilities
- Critical for Indian Ocean/Middle East power projection
- **Now secured for 99 years** - longer than any previous arrangement

### The Irony
Trump criticized a deal that:
- Preserved US military access for nearly a century
- Resolved legal challenges that threatened base operations
- Cost the US nothing (UK pays Mauritius)

### China Angle
- China has been expanding Indian Ocean presence
- Some critics worried Mauritius sovereignty could open door to Chinese influence
- Treaty specifically prohibits foreign military on outer islands
- Diego Garcia remains exclusively US/UK

## Chagossian Perspective
- Excluded from negotiations between UK and Mauritius
- Can now resettle outer islands (Peros Banhos, Salomon Islands)
- Still barred from Diego Garcia
- Decades of displacement trauma unaddressed
- Some Chagossians welcomed deal; others wanted direct UK reparations

## Assessment
The transfer resolves a long-standing decolonization grievance while actually strengthening the legal basis for Diego Garcia operations. Trump's criticism appears driven by:
1. Reflexive opposition to "giving away" territory
2. Desire to create precedent argument for Greenland
3. Misunderstanding of what the deal actually accomplished
