# 2026 National Defense Strategy

## Overview
Released January 23, 2026. The most consequential US defense strategy document in decades. Declares the Western Hemisphere—not the Indo-Pacific—as the US military's top priority. Introduces the "Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine." Deprioritizes China as the sole organizing threat.

**Note:** The Department of Defense has been renamed the **"Department of War"** under this administration.

## Core Reorientation

### Western Hemisphere First
Three pillars of the "Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine":
1. **Restore American military dominance** in the Western Hemisphere
2. **Protect homeland and access to key terrain**
3. **Deny adversaries' ability to position forces** in the hemisphere

Explicitly declares the US will "guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland."

### China Deprioritized
- China remains a major concern but no longer the **sole organizing principle** of US defense
- The Pentagon's top priority is now homeland and Western Hemisphere defense
- Represents a fundamental shift from the Biden-era focus on Indo-Pacific great power competition
- Per CFR analysis: "unpacking the Trump twist on national security strategy"

## Force Posture Changes

### Western Hemisphere Buildup
- **11,000 troops** surged to the Caribbean (8x baseline increase)
- USS Gerald Ford deployed for Operation Southern Spear
- Planned February 2026: 500-person Army multi-domain task force (MDTF) deployment
- Sixth Navy destroyer added to Caribbean presence
- New SOUTHCOM commander: Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Francis Donovan (confirmed Feb 3, 2026)

### Regional Military Agreements
The NDS provides the strategic framework for a pattern of expanded military access:
- [[Panama Canal Crisis|Panama]]: Security MOU for three former Canal Zone facilities (April 2025)
- [[US-Paraguay SOFA]]: Status of Forces Agreement (December 2025); 7th SFG training
- [[Argentina]]: Joint naval base at Ushuaia (Antarctica gateway)
- Joint jungle warfare exercises revived across multiple countries

## Key Terrain

The strategy identifies three critical areas requiring guaranteed US access:
1. **Panama Canal** - Global chokepoint, 5% of world trade
2. **"Gulf of America"** (renamed from Gulf of Mexico) - Energy, maritime domain
3. **Greenland** - Arctic, missile defense, minerals

## Connection to Active Operations

| Operation/Crisis | NDS Linkage |
|-----------------|-------------|
| [[Venezuela]] (Operation Absolute Resolve) | Hemisphere dominance, deny adversary positioning |
| [[Panama Canal Crisis]] | Key terrain access |
| [[Greenland Crisis]] | Key terrain access, [[Golden Dome]] |
| [[US-Paraguay SOFA]] | Regional military partnerships |

## Analytical Reactions

- **CFR**: Characterized as a fundamental reorientation of US defense priorities
- **Military Times**: Noted the unprecedented deprioritization of China
- **FAF (UAE think tank)**: Described as "a reorientation of American military priorities and strategic doctrine"

## Historical Context
- Represents a return to hemispheric focus not seen since pre-WWII era
- Explicitly invokes the [[Monroe Doctrine]] (1823) with a "Trump Corollary"
- Echoes the Roosevelt Corollary (1904) in asserting US right to intervene
- Breaks from the post-9/11 consensus that focused US defense on the Middle East and then the Indo-Pacific
