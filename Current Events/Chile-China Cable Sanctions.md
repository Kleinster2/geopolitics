# Chile-China Cable Sanctions

## Overview

On February 20, 2026, the US State Department revoked visas for three Chilean government officials over their role in advancing the Chile-China Express submarine cable project — a proposed fiber optic link from Valparaiso to Hong Kong. Secretary of State [[Marco Rubio]] announced the restrictions, citing activities that "knowingly directed, authorized, funded, provided significant support to, and/or carried out activities that compromised critical telecommunications infrastructure and undermined regional security."

This is the first known use of personal visa sanctions against officials of a treaty ally over telecommunications infrastructure.

## Officials Targeted

| Official | Role |
|----------|------|
| Juan Carlos Muñoz | Minister of Transport and Telecommunications |
| Claudio Araya | Undersecretary of Telecommunications |
| Guillermo Petersen | Head of Subtel (telecom regulator) cabinet |

All three, plus immediate family members, are ineligible for US entry. Existing visas revoked.

## The Cable Project

The Chile-China Express (CChE) is a proposed submarine cable from Valparaiso to Hong Kong, operated by China Mobile (China's largest state-owned telecom) and Inchcape Shipping Services.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Route | Valparaiso to Hong Kong |
| Length | 10,000+ km (confirmed) |
| Capacity | Up to 16 Tbps per fiber (per Diálogo Américas) |
| Operators | China Mobile, Inchcape Shipping Services |
| Status | Under consideration |

## US Rationale

The US objection centers on [[Digital Sovereignty]] and intelligence risk. [[China]]'s 2017 Cybersecurity Law requires companies and citizens to cooperate with state intelligence services. Data transiting Chinese-managed infrastructure could be made available to Beijing.

US Ambassador Brandon Judd framed it as a question of "who will have hegemony over communications infrastructure in the 21st century" (per Orinoco Tribune).

The US prefers the Humboldt Cable — a Google/NEC ([[Japan]])-backed alternative routing [[Chile]] to [[Australia]] via French Polynesia, already under installation and expected operational by late 2026.

## Chilean Response

Minister Muñoz confirmed he was among the three targeted. He stated that [[Chile]] evaluates infrastructure projects "based on their own merits" without discriminating by origin, and would not approve projects threatening sovereignty (per 24 Horas, La Nación).

## Strategic Significance

| Dimension | Analysis |
|-----------|----------|
| Precedent | First visa sanctions against a sitting allied cabinet minister over telecom infrastructure (confirmed) |
| Escalation pattern | US moved from diplomatic warnings (Ambassador Judd, 2025) to personal sanctions on allied officials |
| Tools | Extends US infrastructure strategy from blocking Chinese vendors (FCC ban on Chinese equipment, August 2025) to punishing allied governments |
| LatAm signal | Message to [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], Peru, and other nations considering Chinese infrastructure projects |
| Chile's dilemma | [[China]] is Chile's largest trading partner (primarily copper exports). US is primary security partner. Binary choice imposed. |

## Connection to Broader Patterns

This fits within multiple trends:
- **US submarine cable security campaign**: FCC barred Chinese equipment (August 2025); Four Eyes countries coordinating on cable routing
- **[[Sanctions]] innovation**: Visa restrictions as lightweight coercive tool — below economic sanctions, above diplomatic demarches
- **Monroe Doctrine reassertion**: The [[2026 National Defense Strategy]] explicitly pivots to Western Hemisphere; cable sanctions enforce hemisphere-level infrastructure alignment
- **[[Digital Sovereignty]] competition**: Who controls LatAm data routing — US hyperscalers or Chinese state telecom?

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2017 | China Cybersecurity Law enacted |
| 2020 | Chile chose NEC/Japan route for Humboldt Cable, rejecting Chinese bid |
| August 2025 | FCC bars Chinese equipment in US-connected submarine cables |
| 2025 | US Ambassador Judd raises concerns with Chilean officials |
| February 20, 2026 | State Department revokes visas for Muñoz, Araya, Petersen |
