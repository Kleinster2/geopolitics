# Abraham Accords

## Overview
Series of normalization agreements between Israel and Arab states, brokered by the Trump administration (2020). Broke the Arab consensus that normalization required Palestinian statehood. Represents major realignment in Middle East politics driven by shared Iran concerns and economic interests.

## The Agreements (2020)

### UAE-Israel (August 13, 2020)
- First Gulf state to normalize
- Full diplomatic relations
- Economic, security, technology cooperation
- UAE framed as preventing Israeli annexation of West Bank
- Most substantive relationship

### Bahrain-Israel (September 15, 2020)
- Signed same ceremony as UAE
- Smaller scale but symbolically important
- Gulf Cooperation Council state
- Close coordination with Saudi Arabia

### Morocco-Israel (December 10, 2020)
- US recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara
- Upgraded existing unofficial ties
- Strong people-to-people ties (Moroccan Jewish diaspora in Israel)
- Defense cooperation

### Sudan-Israel (October 23, 2020)
- Removed from US terrorism list as part of deal
- Least developed relationship
- Internal instability limited follow-through
- Symbolic: Arab League member

## What Changed

### Before Accords
- Arab League position: No normalization without Palestinian state
- Only Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994) had peace treaties
- Gulf states maintained informal ties but no recognition
- Palestinian veto on regional diplomacy

### After Accords
- Palestinian issue decoupled from normalization
- Open cooperation: flights, trade, tourism, security
- Model for potential future deals
- Regional alignment against Iran more visible

## Drivers

### Shared Iran Threat
- Gulf states and Israel share threat perception
- Iranian missiles, proxies, nuclear program
- Enemy of my enemy logic
- Security cooperation deepened

### Economic Interests
- UAE: Technology, tourism, investment
- Israel: Market access, Gulf capital
- Trade: Billions in first years
- Innovation partnerships

### Palestinian Fatigue
- Decades of failed peace process
- Gulf states prioritizing own interests
- Younger generation less invested in Palestinian cause
- Two-state solution seen as unachievable

### Trump Administration Push
- [[Jared Kushner]] as architect
- Transactional approach
- Bilateral deals vs. comprehensive peace
- US incentives (F-35s for UAE, Western Sahara for Morocco)

## Saudi Arabia: The Prize

### Potential
- Largest Arab economy
- Custodian of Two Holy Mosques
- Would complete regional realignment
- Biden and Trump both pursued

### Obstacles
- Palestinian issue (Saudi demands)
- Crown Prince MBS's conditions
- US security guarantees and nuclear cooperation
- October 7, 2023 attack disrupted momentum

### Status (2026)
- Negotiations ongoing but complicated
- Gaza war hardened positions
- Saudi conditions include Palestinian statehood path
- US defense treaty discussions

## Implementation

### UAE-Israel
- Direct flights (dozens daily)
- Trade: ~$2B+ annually
- Tourism: Hundreds of thousands of visitors
- Tech partnerships, investment
- Defense cooperation
- Intelligence sharing

### Challenges
- Gaza conflicts strain public support
- Arab public opinion less favorable than governments
- Morocco relationship affected by regional tensions
- Sudan implementation stalled

## Regional Impact

### Winners
- Israel: Diplomatic breakthrough, regional integration
- UAE: Technology access, regional leadership
- US: Diplomatic achievement, reduced commitment

### Losers
- Palestinians: Leverage reduced
- Iran: Regional isolation increased
- Qatar/Turkey: Competed with UAE-Israel axis

### Uncertain
- Saudi Arabia: Potential but uncommitted
- Egypt/Jordan: Cold peace, watching new ties

## Criticism

### Palestinian Perspective
- Betrayal of Arab consensus
- Normalization without statehood
- Reduced leverage
- "Selling out" narrative

### Regional Critics
- Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas: Resistance narrative
- Some Arab publics: Oppose despite government positions
- October 7 partly response to normalization momentum

## Durability

### Stress Tests
- October 7, 2023 and Gaza war
- Regional conflicts
- Leadership changes
- Public opinion shifts

### Assessment
- Government-to-government ties remain
- Some cooling of visible cooperation during Gaza operations
- Structural interests persist
- Likely to survive but depth uncertain
