# Iran Protests 2025-2026

## Overview
Largest uprising since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, beginning December 28, 2025. Started with shopkeeper strikes in Tehran over economic collapse, spreading to 185 cities across all 31 provinces. At least 1,850 killed and 16,784 arrested. Critically, the merchant class (bazaaris) - historically regime supporters - triggered the uprising.

## Timeline
- **December 2024**: Assad falls in Syria, Iran loses key ally
- **2025**: Israel's 12-day attack on Iran kills senior IRGC commanders, destroys military infrastructure
- **2025**: US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities
- **December 28, 2025**: Protests erupt in Tehran with shopkeeper strikes
- **January 8, 2026**: Nationwide internet blackout imposed
- **January 2026**: Protests continue despite brutal crackdown

## Scale
- **185 cities** across all 31 provinces
- **Death toll (disputed, mid-January 2026)**:
  - 2,403+ killed (HRANA, Jan 14)
  - 12,000+ killed (Iran International, Jan 13)
  - 12,000-20,000 killed (activist groups, CBS News, Jan 13)
  - 16,500-18,000 killed (network of Iranian doctors, The Sunday Times, Jan 17)
- **18,137+ arrested**
- **Deadliest protests in modern Iranian history** (confirmed if higher estimates accurate)
- Described as largest since 1979 revolution
- Now in third week (as of mid-January 2026)

## Latest (Jan 14-18, 2026)

### Death Toll Rising
- Amnesty International: "mass unlawful killings on unprecedented scale"
- Eyewitnesses: brutality "unprecedented and incomparable" to previous waves
- $20 million infrastructure damage in Tehran alone

### Regime Response Hardening
- Justice Minister Rahimi: protesters after Jan 8 guilty of "internal war"
- Protesters categorically labeled "terrorists"
- Regime views protests as proto-revolution to crush completely
- Ayatollah Khamenei called Trump a "tyrant," called for his overthrow

### Execution Postponed
- **Erfan Soltani (26)** - would have been first protester executed
- Postponed after Trump threatened "strong action"
- FM Araghchi on Fox News: "no plan for hanging at all"
- Iran using Fox News to communicate directly with Trump

### US Strike Aborted (Mid-January)

Trump appeared poised to order military strikes on Iran but pulled back:

**Three options presented:**
1. Limited strikes on those killing protesters (signal support)
2. Wider campaign against IRGC/Basij to destabilize regime
3. Strike ballistic missile program (Israel's preference long-term)

**Why Trump backed off:**
- [[Israel]] and Arab allies pressured US not to strike
- US military assessment: Iran would launch larger counter-strike
- No "easy win" - couldn't replicate Venezuela's quick resolution
- USS Gerald Ford still in Western Atlantic from Venezuela operation
- Drones also repositioned away from Middle East
- USS Abraham Lincoln moving from Western Pacific to fill gap

**Internal debate:**
- Tucker Carlson at White House twice (restrainer influence)
- JD Vance faction: focus on China, not Middle East
- Rubio faction: muscular intervention to support protesters
- Trump encompasses both views at different moments

**Alternative options discussed:**
- Dropping Starlink into Iran
- Persian-language broadcasting
- Both dismissed or dismantled

Trump's Truth Social post claiming "800 hangings cancelled" appears to be based on inaccurate information.

**Moral Critique (Kori Schake, AEI):**
- "Morally wrong to encourage protesters to run physical risks when you are not actually going to protect them"
- Trump established red line then walked away
- People getting killed as a result
- Lack of US assistance means regime will succeed at ruthless repression

### Current Status
- Protests easing after brutal crackdown
- Funerals ongoing for civilians and security forces
- International solidarity rallies: Berlin, Paris, London, Istanbul
- US strike threat remains but de-escalated for now

## Key Dynamics

### Why Now?
1. **Economic Collapse**: 42% inflation (December 2025), currency lost 40%+ value
2. **IRGC Decapitation**: Senior commanders killed in Israel's 2025 attacks
3. **Regional Losses**: Assad fell, Axis of Resistance degraded
4. **Accumulated Grievances**: Building since 2022 "Woman Life Freedom" protests
5. **Regime Exposed**: 12-day war and B-2 bombing showed regime is "not 100 feet tall"—not omnipotent or inevitable

### Systemic Economic Crisis (Confirmed)

**Banking Crisis:**
- **Ayandeh Bank collapse** (late 2025) - confirmed trigger for protests
  - ~$5 billion in losses from bad loans
  - Central bank official: "a Ponzi scheme" (self-lending scheme)
  - Run by regime-affiliated individuals
  - **Five other Iranian banks** in similarly fragile condition (reported)

**Economic Indicators (2025-2026):**
- Rial lost **84% of value** against dollar in 2025
- Food prices rose **72% annually**
- Purchasing power fallen **90%+ over 8 years**
- Capital flight: $10-20 billion left Iran in 2025 (Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, Virginia Tech)

**Government Response:**
- New Central Bank governor appointed (Abdolnasser Hemmati)
- Monthly food coupon system introduced January 2026
- Unable to print way out of crisis

**Assessment:**
Victoria Coates (Heritage) argues problems are "not solvable"—regime may collapse under own weight without US military intervention. This assessment is supported by independent economic analysis: Iran experiencing "deepest and longest economic crisis in modern history" (Al Jazeera).

> "The Islamic Republic is dying. While it may suppress this round of protests, it will not emerge from 2026 with its authority, cohesion, or capacity preserved." — GIS Reports

### Merchant Class Revolt
Critical development - the bazaaris historically support the regime:
- Currency collapse destroying businesses
- Food prices up 72%, medical goods up 50%
- Import costs skyrocketing
- Traditional regime base now turning
- Echoes of 1979: merchants abandoned the Shah too

### Security Force Dynamics
- IRGC weakened by 2025 Israeli strikes
- Lower-level commanders now in charge
- [[Artesh]] (regular army) potentially sitting out
- Historical precedent: Shah's military fragmented under pressure

## Regime Response
- Nationwide internet blackout (January 8, 2026)
- Basij militia deployments
- Mass arrests (16,784+)
- Lethal force (1,850+ killed)
- Khamenei: "rioters must be put in their place"
- New central bank governor appointed to address currency crisis

## International Response

### United States
- Trump encouraged protesters, said "help is on its way"
- Threatened military intervention if violent crackdown continues
- Warned against executing protesters

### Background Events
- December 2024: Assad regime fell in Syria
- 2025: Israel's 12-day attack assassinating senior IRGC leaders
- 2025: US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities

## Strategic Implications

### For the Regime
- Weakest position since 1979
- Multiple simultaneous crises
- Leadership vacuum in IRGC
- Economic tools exhausted
- Lost Syria, proxies degraded

### Regional Impact
- **Turkey**: Watching closely, potential opportunities
- **Saudi Arabia**: Concerned about Sunni-Shia spillover
- **Iraq**: Buffer state, already unstable
- **Israel**: Continuing pressure strategy
- **Gulf States**: Monitoring for refugee/instability spillover

## Historical Parallels

### 1979 Revolution
- Shah appeared strong until suddenly wasn't
- Military fragmented when crisis deepened
- Merchants (bazaaris) were crucial swing factor
- Same dynamics potentially emerging now

### 2022 "Woman, Life, Freedom"
- Largest protests in decades at the time
- Regime survived but depleted
- Set stage for current crisis

## Key Uncertainties

1. **Will Artesh intervene?** Secular military may not save theocratic regime
2. **IRGC cohesion?** Can weakened force maintain control?
3. **US intervention?** Trump has threatened military action
4. **Succession crisis?** Khamenei aging, no clear successor path
5. **Economic breaking point?** Currency in freefall

## Competing Scenarios

### Regime Survives
- IRGC maintains cohesion despite losses
- Brutal crackdown succeeds
- External pressure eases
- Economy stabilizes somehow

### Regime Change
- IRGC fragments or sits out
- Artesh refuses to fire on civilians
- Merchants/middle class sustain pressure
- Possible military-led transition

### Prolonged Instability
- Neither side wins decisively
- Economic collapse continues
- Regional spillover
- Failed state trajectory
