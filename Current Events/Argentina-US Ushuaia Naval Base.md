# Argentina-US Ushuaia Naval Base

## Overview
An evolving US-Argentina naval collaboration centered on the Integrated Naval Base (Base Naval Integrada) in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego -- the southernmost naval port in Argentina. Originally an Argentine construction project begun in 2022, it evolved under [[Javier Milei]] into a joint US-Argentina collaboration aimed at countering Chinese influence in the South Atlantic and Antarctica. The arrangement fits squarely within the [[2026 National Defense Strategy]] and "Trump Corollary to Monroe Doctrine."

**Critical ambiguity**: The Argentine Defense Ministry has officially denied US co-operation of the base, calling it an Argentine sovereignty project. Milei himself has publicly described it as a joint collaboration. This contradiction appears deliberate.

**Status**: As of January 2026, physical progress at 9.13% with ~$8.3 million invested. Estimated total cost: $300-360 million. The 2026 national budget contains no new allocations (per Zona-Militar).

## Strategic Geography

- ~1,000 km from Antarctica -- closer than Chile's Punta Arenas or UK's Falkland Islands
- Controls access to the **Drake Passage** (only route between South America and Antarctica)
- Proximity to **Strait of Magellan** (Atlantic-Pacific connection)
- Overlooking South Atlantic where ~360 Chinese fishing vessels operate at edge of Argentina's EEZ

**What the base would provide**: Antarctic logistics hub; maritime interdiction capability; potential submarine resupply point (reported, unverified); monitoring of Chinese fishing fleets and naval activity.

## Milei's Motivation

Milei's approach represents a fundamental break from Argentina's post-Falklands non-alignment:
- Strong personal affinity with Trump; anti-China foreign policy orientation
- Withdrew Argentina from BRICS membership process
- Requested NATO Global Partner status (April 2024)
- Purchased 24 F-16s from Denmark with US foreign military financing ($40M -- first US military aid to Argentina in over 20 years)

**Economic dimension** (reported, circumstantial): The arrangement has been linked to the $20 billion US-Argentina currency swap finalized in October 2025. Decree 697/2025 was published approximately one week after the bailout announcement (per Buenos Aires Herald).

**Sovereignty argument**: Milei argued US support "endorses the claim over Antarctica" and strengthens Argentina's Malvinas sovereignty claim. Critics contest this, noting the US sided with Britain during the 1982 Falklands War and has shown no indication of supporting Argentine territorial claims against a NATO ally. The US had not provided military financing to Argentina for over two decades before the 2024 F-16 deal ($300M, 24 aircraft from Denmark, $40M US foreign military financing).

## SOUTHCOM Connection

SOUTHCOM involvement is direct:
- Admiral Holsey personally visited Ushuaia and met with Milei
- SOUTHCOM posted about the visit emphasizing maritime route security
- Stated US interest: countering Chinese influence in South Atlantic and Antarctica
- China operates four Antarctic bases and is building a fifth

US Southern Command is being merged into "US Army Western Hemisphere Command" (West-Hemcom), signaling upgraded hemisphere priority (per SOUTHCOM).

## Domestic Opposition

**Constitutional challenge**: Article 75 of the Argentine Constitution requires legislative approval for foreign troop entry. Milei bypassed Congress using a Decree of Necessity and Urgency (DNU).

**Key opponents**:
- Peronist senators accused the government of creating a joint foreign military base
- Mayor of Ushuaia (Walter Vuoto) denounced exercises as sacrificing sovereignty
- Governor of Tierra del Fuego (Gustavo Melella) rejected port takeover, announced legal challenges
- Ushuaia held demonstrations against sovereignty concessions

(per Buenos Aires Times, Prensa Latina)

## Regional Reactions

**Chile**: Closely monitoring. Chile views Ushuaia as directly competitive with Punta Arenas as Antarctica gateway. Chilean parliament responded with investment in southern ports and legal oversight. Chilean Defense Commission held a session in Antarctica amid the controversy. Chilean military experts proposed confidence-building measures: trilateral Chile-Argentina-US naval exercises, transparency agreements, and reciprocal military visits. Concern about overlapping Antarctic sovereignty claims (Chile 53rd-90th meridians; Argentina 25th-74th -- significant overlap).

**Brazil**: Critics argue the arrangement strains Argentina's regional relationships and fits Milei's pattern of distancing from regional institutions.

## Antarctic Treaty Implications

1. **Antarctic Treaty (1959, until at least 2048)** suspends sovereignty claims and prohibits military activity in Antarctica. Ushuaia is on Argentine soil but its role as logistics hub blurs the line.
2. **1984 Treaty of Peace and Friendship** (Chile-Argentina, Vatican-brokered) established Beagle Channel as demilitarized zone. Critics argue the base arrangement violates this.
3. **2048 renegotiation**: Positioning now through infrastructure may shape bargaining power then.
4. **China's Antarctic expansion**: Four bases plus a fifth under construction -- cited by US as justification for increased presence via Ushuaia.
