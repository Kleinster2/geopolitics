# European Nuclear Debate (2025-2026)

## Overview
Growing debate across Europe about developing independent nuclear deterrence as doubts mount about US extended deterrence under Trump. France and UK already have nuclear weapons; the question is whether to extend protection to allies or whether non-nuclear states should develop their own capabilities.

## Drivers

### Loss of Confidence in US Umbrella
Two shocks triggered the debate:
1. **Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine** - heightened threat perception
2. **Trump administration (2025-)** - doubts about US commitment to NATO

Per Carnegie Endowment: "Recent leaks confirmed antagonism leading members of the administration feel toward Europe, leading Europeans to seriously worry about whether Washington will continue to extend nuclear deterrence to the continent."

### Greenland Crisis
US threatening a NATO ally over [[Greenland Crisis|Greenland]] has accelerated the debate. If the US would threaten Denmark, what guarantees remain for other allies?

## Country Positions

### France
- **Current arsenal**: ~290 warheads
- **Macron (March 2025)**: Offered to open "strategic debate with European allies" on assigning France's nuclear mission to protect others on the continent

### United Kingdom
- **Current arsenal**: ~225 warheads (Trident submarines)
- Potential partner for "Eurodeterrent" with France
- Post-Brexit, defense relationship with Europe unclear

### Germany
- **Friedrich Merz (February 2025)**: Declared US "no longer trustworthy," called for nuclear sharing talks with Paris
- Historical reluctance to nuclear weapons now being reconsidered
- Could contribute funding/hosting rather than development

### Poland
- **PM Donald Tusk**: Said Poland "is talking seriously" with Paris about French nuclear protection
- Floated idea of Poland acquiring its own nuclear weapons
- Told parliament: "Poland must pursue the most advanced capabilities, including nuclear and modern unconventional weapons"

### Finland and Sweden
- New NATO members with heightened threat perception
- Technical challenges: only have light-water reactors (not suitable for weapons-grade plutonium production)
- More likely to seek protection from France/UK than develop own

### Baltic States
- Most vulnerable to Russian aggression
- Strong interest in any European nuclear umbrella
- No indigenous capacity

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Anglo-French "Eurodeterrent"
- Extend UK/French nuclear umbrella to EU/NATO allies
- Model: US extended deterrence, but European-controlled
- Challenges: Command and control, cost sharing, credibility

### Option 2: EU Nuclear Force (MLF Revival)
- Multilateral Force concept from Kennedy era
- Shared ownership/control
- Challenges: NPT constraints, national sovereignty concerns

### Option 3: NATO Nuclear Sharing Expansion
- Expand existing B61 arrangements
- More countries host US weapons
- Challenge: Depends on US commitment (the core problem)

### Option 4: National Programs
- Individual countries develop own weapons
- Most destabilizing option
- NPT withdrawal required for most

## Technical Feasibility

[[Peter Zeihan]] claims countries like Lithuania, Poland, Germany, Finland, Sweden, and Romania "could develop a crude nuclear device in a matter of weeks."

**Expert assessment** (per Euronews/Arms Control Association):
- **Exaggerated** - While some European states have elements required, "chances of another European state going nuclear are slim"
- Challenges: fissile material production, delivery systems, testing, time
- Finland/Sweden lack suitable reactors
- Germany has capability but deep political/constitutional barriers
- Poland would need years, not weeks

**More realistic timeline**: Years to decades for non-nuclear state, depending on starting point

## Obstacles

### Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
- Most European states are signatories
- Would need to withdraw (6-month notice)
- Would damage international nonproliferation regime
- Potential sanctions/isolation

### Domestic Politics
- Strong anti-nuclear movements in Germany
- Public opinion varies by country
- Coalition governments complicate decisions

### Technical Barriers
- Fissile material production
- Weapons design expertise (limited outside UK/France)
- Delivery systems (missiles, aircraft)
- Testing (banned under CTBT)

### Coordination Challenges
- Who controls? Who pays?
- NATO integration vs. EU defense
- UK post-Brexit relationship
- Command authority in crisis

## Current Status (January 2026)

Per Carnegie Endowment: "Heading into 2026, Europe still lacks a shared framework and a coherent epistemic community on deterrence."

The debate remains at early stages:
- Political discussions happening (confirmed)
- No concrete programs announced
- Focus on extending French/UK umbrella rather than new weapons states

## Zeihan's Assessment

> "We're now at the point where there's active political discussions going on in all those countries and more about how to prepare for what's next and nukes are absolutely part of the conversation."

He argues Europe lacks time for conventional buildup given the revolution in military affairs visible in Ukraine, making nuclear deterrence the faster path.
