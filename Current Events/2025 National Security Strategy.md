# 2025 National Security Strategy

## Overview
Trump administration's National Security Strategy, released December 4, 2025. ~40 pages. Represents dramatic departure from previous administrations, elevating Western Hemisphere and reframing security around immigration, economic vitality, and regional dominance rather than global leadership.

## Document

**Full text:** [White House PDF](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf)

## Structure

Four sections:

1. **"What Is American Strategy"** - Critiques previous administrations
2. **"What We Should Want"** - Border control, Trump Corollary to Monroe Doctrine
3. **"How to Get What We Want"** - Institutional competence, removing "DEI"
4. **"The Strategy"** - Principles, priorities, regional approaches

## Key Themes

### Organizing Principles
- "America First" foreign policy
- "Peace through strength"
- End of global burden-bearing

**Direct quote:**
> "The days of the United States propping up the entire world order like Atlas are over."

### Threat Hierarchy (per Brookings analysis)
Immigration/"mass migration" positioned as major external threat—potentially more significant than China, Russia, or terrorism.

### Trump Corollary to Monroe Doctrine
Asserts neo-imperialist influence in Western Hemisphere. Identifies three hemispheric threats:
1. Migration
2. Drugs/crime
3. Chinese presence

See: [[Donroe Doctrine]], [[Monroe Doctrine]]

## Regional Approaches

### Western Hemisphere
Elevated to dominant geographic priority (confirmed). Focus on removing Chinese influence from ports and critical infrastructure.

**Coates (Heritage) characterization:** "Not a major component in 2017 NSS, front and center in 2025."

### China
Treated "almost entirely through an economic lens" (per Brookings analyst). Emphasis on:
- Rebalancing economic relationship
- Removing Chinese presence from Western Hemisphere
- Military dimensions receive minimal attention

**Notable:** This differs from [[Elbridge Colby]]'s denial strategy framework which emphasizes military competition.

### Europe
- Burden-*shifting* not burden-sharing
- "Assume far greater responsibility for your own security"
- Criticism of "civilizational erasure"
- Signals support for "patriotic" European parties
- One expert: uses "the language of tyranny" toward allies

**Direct quote:**
> "Managing European relations with Russia will require significant U.S. diplomatic engagement"

### Middle East
Reframed priorities (details TBD from document review).

## Four-Theater Framework

Victoria Coates (Heritage) argues document identifies four theaters:

| Theater | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| **Western Hemisphere** | Elevated priority, Monroe Doctrine |
| **Indo-Pacific** | China economic competition |
| **Europe** | Russia, allied burden-shifting |
| **Middle East** | Iran, Israel |

**Note:** Coates has institutional interest—Heritage pushed Western Hemisphere framing before this NSS.

## Comparison to Previous

| NSS | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| **2017 (Trump 1.0)** | Great power competition, "America First" |
| **2022 (Biden)** | Democracy vs. autocracy, allies, climate |
| **2025 (Trump 2.0)** | Western Hemisphere, immigration, burden-shifting |

## Critiques

**On Monroe Doctrine revival (Brookings):** Framework is "unnecessary and counterproductive" given U.S. intervention's "bitter legacy" in Latin America.

**On Europe section:** Uses "the language of tyranny" toward traditional partners.
