# Philippines ASEAN Chairmanship 2026

## Overview
The [[Philippines]] assumed the [[ASEAN]] chairmanship on January 1, 2026 (handed over by Malaysia, October 28, 2025). Myanmar was originally scheduled by alphabetical rotation but was skipped due to the ongoing civil war. Theme: **"Navigating Our Future, Together."** The chairmanship creates an inherent tension: Manila must serve as ASEAN's honest broker while being the member state with the most active confrontations with [[China]] in the South China Sea.

## Three Pillars

1. **Peace and Security Anchors** -- regional stability through norms, dialogue, maritime cooperation grounded in international law, ASEAN centrality
2. **Prosperity Corridors** -- economic integration through digital transformation, trade facilitation, innovation
3. **People Empowerment** -- healthcare, education, youth, "silver economy" (aging populations)

Cross-cutting emphasis on responsible AI use across all three pillars.

## Key Summits and Meetings

| Event | Date | Location |
|-------|------|----------|
| ASEAN Tourism Forum | January 26-30, 2026 | Cebu City |
| ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Retreat | January 29, 2026 | Cebu City |
| 48th ASEAN Leaders' Summit | May 8-9, 2026 | Cebu City |

| 49th ASEAN Leaders' Summit and Related Summits | November 10-12, 2026 | Manila (PICC) |

The Philippines will host approximately **650 ASEAN-related meetings** throughout 2026.

## South China Sea and Code of Conduct

Manila has made concluding the SCS **Code of Conduct (CoC)** a signature goal, targeting **July 2026**. Formal negotiations ongoing since 2018, building on 2002 Declaration on Conduct of Parties.

**Philippines' position**: CoC must be (a) legally binding, (b) monitored by ASEAN-led mechanisms, (c) grounded in UNCLOS and the **2016 arbitral ruling** (10th anniversary: July 12, 2026).

**China's opposition**: Resists legally binding mechanism; opposes external involvement; rejects reference to 2016 ruling.

**Analyst assessments**:
- Chatham House (December 2025): Agreement unlikely in 2026 given China-Philippines tensions
- CSIS: Realistic outcomes limited to incident-avoidance protocols, standardized coast guard communications
- The Diplomat (November 2025): Manila hopes to conclude but faces structural obstacles

## Marcos Jr. vs. Duterte (2017 Chairmanship)

| Dimension | 2017 (Duterte) | 2026 (Marcos Jr.) |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| China approach | "Golden age" of bilateral relations; shelved arbitral ruling | Assertive; CoC as centerpiece; arbitral ruling anniversary |
| SCS in communique | Stripped references to island-building, weapons deployment | Expected to highlight international law, UNCLOS, CoC |
| US alliance | Frayed; threatened to end VFA and MDT | Strongest in decades; 9 EDCA sites, 500+ joint exercises |
| Strategic orientation | "Independent foreign policy"; pivot toward China | US-allied; minilateral defense network |

Per Lowy Institute: a "marked contrast from when Manila last held the chairmanship in 2017."

(per CSIS AMTI, Lowy Institute, Modern Diplomacy)

## US-Philippines Alliance

Under Marcos Jr., defense ties are at their strongest:
- **EDCA**: Expanded from 5 to **9 sites** (4 new April 2024, emphasizing northern Luzon near Taiwan and Palawan near Spratlys)
- **Joint exercises**: 500+ military engagements approved for 2026 (Balikatan, Salaknib, Kamandag)
- **Task Force Philippines**: Unveiled November 1, 2025 by Defense Secretary Hegseth and Philippine DND Secretary Teodoro at ADMM+; increases combined planning and interoperability
- **Minilateral network**: Japan ACSA (January 2026); New Zealand SOVFA; Germany, India, France VFA negotiations

**"Rhetoric vs. reality" gap** (per CSIS): While Manila emphasizes ASEAN centrality, its actual security strategy relies on bilateral and minilateral partnerships outside ASEAN's consensus framework.

**Diplomatic balancing**: Marcos reportedly seeking a **Xi Jinping visit to Manila** (first since 2018) as a diplomatic achievement during the chairmanship year, attempting to de-escalate while maintaining the US alliance for deterrence (per Nikkei Asia, China US Focus/Heydarian analysis).

## Myanmar Crisis

Foreign Secretary Maria Theresa Lazaro designated as **ASEAN Special Envoy on Myanmar** for 2026.

**Five-Point Consensus (5PC)** failure: Adopted April 2021, has achieved almost nothing. Violence escalated; junta ignored ASEAN demands. The junta held elections in late 2025, widely derided as illegitimate.

**Key developments under Philippines' chair**:
- January 7, 2026: Lazaro visited Naypyidaw, met Senior General Min Aung Hlaing (criticized by The Irrawaddy as granting junta legitimacy)
- January 29, 2026: At AMM Retreat, Lazaro stated ASEAN **"has not endorsed"** the Myanmar election

**Internal split**: Thailand pushing ASEAN to soften position on the junta; other members resist (per Foreign Policy, February 4, 2026).

## Economic Priorities

**Five Priority Economic Deliverables**:
1. ASEAN Leaders' Declaration on Strategic Trade Management (dual-use goods)
2. ASEAN Center of Excellence for MSMEs
3. **DEFA** (Digital Economy Framework Agreement) completion -- ASEAN digital economy valued at ~$300B, projected $1T by 2030 (per WEF)
4. ASEAN Center of Excellence for Creative Industries
5. Regional roadmap for **semiconductors and critical minerals** (semiconductors are Philippines' top export: $39.1B in 2024; **AFISS** -- ASEAN Framework for Integrated Semiconductor Supply Chain -- adopted as non-binding foundation)

ASEAN adopted **Minerals Development Vision 2045** and **AMCAP-IV 2026-2030** as first five-year critical minerals framework.

## Taiwan Contingency

No formal ASEAN contingency mechanism exists. All 10 members adhere to one-China policy. CFR assesses >50% probability of a cross-strait crisis in 2026.

**Philippines' inherent tension as chair**: Northern EDCA bases are ~200km from Taiwan. The Luzon Strait is the primary waterway linking the SCS to the Pacific. Manila must maintain ASEAN's consensus stance of restraint while being the member most directly affected by any Taiwan contingency.

(per ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Statement 2022, CNAS, Johns Hopkins FAR)

## Domestic Headwinds

Per Fortune (January 14, 2026): The Philippines enters its chairmanship on weaker footing -- a $2 billion corruption scandal (flood management funds), GDP growth falling to a four-year low of 4%, and anti-Marcos protests. This limits Marcos Jr.'s foreign policy bandwidth.
