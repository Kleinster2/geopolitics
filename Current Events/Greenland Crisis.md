# Greenland Crisis (2026)

## Overview
Unprecedented situation where a NATO ally (United States) is openly threatening to forcibly annex territory of another NATO ally (Denmark). Trump's threats to take Greenland have triggered European military deployments and raised existential questions about NATO's future.

## Background

### Greenland Basics
- **Status**: Autonomous territory of Denmark
- **Population**: ~57,000
- **Area**: World's largest island (836,330 sq mi)
- **Location**: North Atlantic/Arctic
- **Self-rule**: Since 2009, increasing autonomy

### Strategic Value
- **Arctic shipping routes** (opening due to climate change)
- **Mineral resources** (rare earths, uranium, oil)
- **Military position**: US Thule Air Base (Space Force)
- **Early warning radar** systems
- **Control of North Atlantic approaches**

### Previous US Interest
- 1946: Truman offered $100 million
- 2019: Trump floated purchase (Denmark refused)
- 2025-26: Escalated to annexation threats

## The 2026 Crisis

### Trump's Position
- Openly threatening **forcible annexation**
- Cites strategic Arctic importance
- Claims essential for US national security
- Willingness to use military force implied

**NYT Interview (January 2026):**
When asked why he needs to *own* Greenland when existing treaties allow the US to reopen 15-16 former bases:
- "It's psychological. I just feel like I need to own it."
- Real estate developer instinct: wants to own the building, not lease it
- Also stated: "Nothing can stop me, even international law—depends on how I interpret international law"
- When pressed on constraints: his own morality is the only restraint

### Denmark's Response
- PM Frederiksen: Trump "should be taken seriously"
- Rejected any sale or transfer
- Called it potential death of NATO
- Hosting allied military forces

### European Military Deployments (Jan 2026)

| Country | Deployment |
|---------|------------|
| **France** | Military team on ground, reinforcing air/sea/land |
| **Finland** | Military liaison officers |
| **Denmark** | Joint exercises with allies |

### NATO Implications
- Frederiksen: "If the United States decides to attack another NATO country, then everything would stop – that includes NATO"
- Article 5 paradox: US attacking ally it's supposed to defend
- Would shatter post-WWII alliance system
- Experts: Europe should "prepare for Greenland's annexation and end of NATO"

## Strategic Context

### Arctic Competition
- Climate change opening Arctic routes
- Russia militarizing Arctic
- China declaring itself "near-Arctic state"
- New shipping lanes reduce transit times
- Resource extraction becoming viable

### US Thule Air Base
- Already hosts US Space Force
- Ballistic missile early warning
- Satellite tracking
- Would remain regardless of sovereignty

### Why Now?
- Trump's transactional approach to allies
- Arctic importance rising
- China interest concerns
- Resource nationalism
- Demonstrates "America First" to extreme

### Walt's Analysis (January 2026)
[[Stephen Walt]] argues there is **no actual security or economic necessity**:

> "There's no economic or security reason why we have to [control Greenland]. The current treaty arrangements give the United States as much access as it might ever want. This is all about essentially marking territory."

Key points:
- US already has **Thule Air Base** with full access
- Existing treaty gives US everything it needs militarily
- Not about security - about **territorial assertion**
- Example of [[Predatory Hegemony]]: extracting from allies because you can
- Demonstrates willingness to threaten allies, not just adversaries

## Scenarios

### Negotiated Outcome
- Enhanced US access/basing rights
- Greenland independence with US partnership
- Economic arrangement

### Continued Standoff
- European forces remain
- Diplomatic tension persists
- NATO paralyzed

### Worst Case
- US military action against NATO ally
- Alliance collapses
- European security architecture shattered
- Global realignment
