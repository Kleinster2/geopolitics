# Brexit

## Overview
United Kingdom's withdrawal from the [[European Union]]. Referendum June 2016 (52-48% Leave), formal exit January 31, 2020, transition ended December 31, 2020. First and only member state to leave the EU.

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **June 23, 2016** | Referendum: 52% Leave, 48% Remain |
| **March 29, 2017** | Article 50 triggered |
| **January 31, 2020** | UK formally leaves EU |
| **December 31, 2020** | Transition period ends |
| **December 24, 2020** | Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) signed |

## The Article 50 Process

[[Lisbon Treaty]] Article 50 provided first formal exit mechanism:
1. Member state notifies intention to leave
2. Two-year negotiation period (extendable)
3. Withdrawal agreement concluded
4. Future relationship negotiated separately

UK was the test case - procedure had never been used before.

## Key Agreements

### Withdrawal Agreement (2019)
- "Divorce settlement" - UK financial obligations (~£35-39 billion)
- Citizens' rights (EU citizens in UK, UK citizens in EU)
- Northern Ireland Protocol (customs border in Irish Sea)

### Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA, 2020)
- Zero tariffs, zero quotas on goods
- Services largely excluded
- No single market membership
- No customs union membership
- Regulatory divergence permitted

## Consequences

### For UK
- End of free movement (both directions)
- Trade friction with EU (customs checks, paperwork)
- Financial services access reduced
- Regulatory autonomy gained
- Immigration policy control

### For EU
- Loss of major member (2nd largest economy, nuclear power, UNSC seat)
- Demonstrated exit is possible but costly
- Strengthened remaining unity (initially)
- Set precedent for Article 50 process

### Northern Ireland
Unique status - effectively remains in EU single market for goods:
- Customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland
- Ongoing political tensions
- Windsor Framework (2023) eased some friction

## Significance for EU Trade Policy

### Precedent Effects
- Showed leaving EU means leaving trade benefits
- "No cherry-picking" - EU held firm on indivisibility of single market
- Strengthened EU negotiating position in other contexts

### Contrast with Current Deals
| Aspect | Brexit | EU-Mercosur | EU-India |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Direction | UK leaving EU | External partners joining EU market |
| UK/Partner gets | Reduced access | Enhanced access |
| Controversy | Exit terms | Entry terms |
