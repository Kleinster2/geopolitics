# Elbridge Colby

## Overview
American defense strategist and the leading voice for China prioritization in US foreign policy. Author of *The Strategy of Denial* (2021). Co-founder of The Marathon Initiative. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy in Trump 2.0 (confirmed 2025). Previously Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and Force Development (2017-2018) where he led the 2018 National Defense Strategy.

## Positions

### Trump 2.0
- **Under Secretary of Defense for Policy** (2025-present)
- Third-ranking civilian at Pentagon
- Responsible for defense strategy and policy

### Previous
- **Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense** (2017-2018) - Led 2018 NDS
- **Marathon Initiative** - Co-founder (think tank on great power competition)

## Core Arguments

Colby's views are on-the-record in his book, articles, and testimony:

### China as Primary Threat
- China is the only country that can threaten US primacy
- Other threats (Russia, Iran, terrorism) are secondary
- US must focus limited resources on the decisive theater

### Denial Strategy for Taiwan
- Goal: Make Chinese invasion too costly to attempt
- Not about "winning" a war but denying China quick victory
- Requires forward-deployed forces, allied integration, munitions stockpiles
- Time is critical—window narrowing as PLA modernizes

### Prioritization Over Omnipresence
- US cannot be strong everywhere simultaneously
- Europe should handle Russia (with US support, not leadership)
- Middle East is a distraction from main competition
- Must make hard choices about where to commit forces

### Allied Burden-Sharing
- Allies must do more—US cannot subsidize their defense indefinitely
- NATO Europeans should lead on Russia
- Japan, Australia, Taiwan need greater self-defense capacity
- US provides nuclear umbrella and surge capability, not permanent garrison

## Key Quotes

From *The Strategy of Denial* (2021):

> "The United States should focus its military strategy on denying China hegemony over Asia."

On prioritization:

> "We need to accept that we can't do everything. Trying to be strong everywhere means being strong nowhere."

## Contrast with Other Factions

| Position | Colby | Interventionists | Restrainers |
|----------|-------|------------------|-------------|
| China | Primary threat, focus resources | Major threat among several | Threat inflated |
| Europe | Allies' responsibility | US must lead NATO | Withdraw |
| Middle East | Distraction | Vital interests | Withdraw |
| Taiwan | Defend (denial strategy) | Defend | Ambiguous |

## Publications
