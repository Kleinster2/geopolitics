# Artesh (Islamic Republic of Iran Army)

## Overview
Iran's conventional regular military, distinct from the ideological [[IRGC]]. Secular in character, professional in orientation, and notably less politically engaged. In a regime crisis, Artesh behavior could be decisive - it may not defend the theocracy.

## Basic Facts
- **Persian Name**: Artesh-e Jomhuri-ye Eslami-ye Iran
- **Founded**: 1925 (Imperial Army), restructured 1979
- **Personnel**: ~420,000 active
- **Reports to**: Supreme Leader (constitutionally), but less ideologically committed

## Key Distinction from IRGC

| Aspect | Artesh | IRGC |
|--------|--------|------|
| Character | Professional, secular | Ideological, revolutionary |
| Mission | National defense | Regime protection |
| Loyalty | Iran (the nation) | Islamic Revolution |
| Politics | Generally apolitical | Deeply political |
| Economics | Military budget only | Vast business empire |

## Historical Context

### Pre-Revolution
- Imperial Iranian Armed Forces
- Western-trained and equipped
- Shah's primary power base
- Fragmented during 1979 revolution

### 1979 Lesson
Critical precedent: when pressure mounted, Shah's military did not hold together:
- Officers defected or stayed neutral
- Units refused to fire on civilians
- Military cohesion collapsed rapidly
- Enabled revolutionary success

### Post-Revolution
- Purged of Shah loyalists
- Subordinated to IRGC in priority
- Kept deliberately weaker
- Regime trusts IRGC more

## Structure

### Ground Forces
- Conventional warfare focus
- Territorial defense
- ~350,000 personnel

### Navy (IRIN)
- Blue water capability
- Different from IRGC Navy (coastal/asymmetric)
- Persian Gulf, Caspian Sea

### Air Force (IRIAF)
- Aging aircraft (F-14, F-4, MiG-29)
- Limited by sanctions
- Conventional air defense

## Strategic Significance

### Regime Crisis Scenario
In protests or instability:
1. IRGC is first line of regime defense
2. If IRGC wavers, regime may call Artesh
3. **Key question**: Will Artesh fire on civilians?
4. Secular officers may refuse
5. Could enable regime change

### Why Artesh Might Sit Out
- No ideological commitment to theocracy
- Professional military culture
- History of fragmentation in 1979
- Officers may see post-regime future
- Less to lose than IRGC commanders

### Why Artesh Might Support Regime
- Institutional loyalty
- Officer benefits
- Fear of chaos
- No clear alternative

## Current Relevance

### 2024-2025 Crisis
As [[Iran Protests 2025-2026]] intensify:
- IRGC leadership decapitated (12 commanders killed)
- Artesh watching from sidelines
- If IRGC loses control, Artesh decision becomes critical
- Historical parallel to Shah's military suggests fragmentation possible

### Competing Loyalties
- Khamenei as Supreme Leader (constitutional)
- Nation vs. regime distinction
- Professional vs. ideological identity
- Career survival calculations
