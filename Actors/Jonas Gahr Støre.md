# Jonas Gahr Støre

## Overview
Prime Minister of Norway since 2021. Former Foreign Minister (2005-2012). Career diplomat before politics.

## Position on Trump 2.0

### Greenland Crisis Response (January 2026)
At Davos (January 22, 2026), Støre responded to Trump's Greenland threats:

- Said Europe had "finally found its spine" in standing up to Trump
- Texted Trump on behalf of Norway and Finland to calm tensions
- Received "blistering letter" back about the Nobel Peace Prize
- Clarified that the Norwegian government cannot control the Nobel Committee (independent body)

On US relations:
> "It's going to be hard for Europe to carry on trusting America in the way that it has."

On European defense:
- Trump's behavior has made it "perhaps easier" for European leaders to justify increased defense spending to populations
- "Our relationship with America is over. It's not the one we thought it was."

### Assessment
Støre represents the Nordic response to Trump 2.0: acknowledging the transatlantic relationship is fundamentally changed while emphasizing European need for strategic autonomy and increased defense spending.
