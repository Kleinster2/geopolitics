# Court of Justice of the European Union

## Overview
Supreme court of the [[European Union]]. Ensures EU law interpreted and applied uniformly across member states. Rulings are binding and cannot be appealed.

Also called: CJEU, European Court of Justice (ECJ - technically just one part of CJEU).

## Structure

### Court of Justice (ECJ)
- **Judges**: 27 (one per member state), 9-year terms
- **Advocates General**: 11, provide independent legal opinions
- Handles most important cases, appeals, treaty interpretation

### General Court
- **Judges**: 54 (two per member state)
- First instance for competition, state aid, trade defense cases
- Appeals go to ECJ

## Key Powers

### Preliminary Rulings
National courts can ask ECJ to interpret EU law. Most common procedure:
- National court uncertain about EU law meaning
- Refers question to ECJ
- ECJ ruling binds all EU courts on that interpretation

### Infringement Proceedings
Commission can sue member states for violating EU law:
1. Commission identifies breach
2. Formal notice to member state
3. If not resolved, case to Court
4. Court can impose fines for non-compliance

### Annulment Actions
Challenges to legality of EU acts:
- Member states, institutions, or affected parties can sue
- Court can annul illegal EU legislation

### Treaty Interpretation Opinions
**Key for trade policy**: Court can give opinions on whether international agreements are compatible with EU treaties.

## Trade Agreement Role

### Opinion Procedure (Article 218(11) TFEU)
Before EU concludes international agreement, Court can be asked:
- Is the agreement compatible with EU treaties?
- Does it fall within EU exclusive competence?
- Opinion is binding - if negative, agreement cannot be concluded as drafted

### Key Precedent: Opinion 2/15 (EU-Singapore, 2017)
Court ruled on EU-Singapore FTA competence:
- Trade in goods/services: **exclusive EU competence**
- Portfolio investment: **shared competence** (requires national parliaments)
- ISDS: **shared competence**

This ruling shaped all subsequent trade deal structures, including the "split deal" strategy.

### EU-Mercosur Referral (January 2026)
[[European Parliament]] referred [[EU-Mercosur FTA]] asking:
1. Was the "split deal" procedure lawful?
2. Does the "rebalancing mechanism" restrict EU's treaty powers?

**Timeline**: Court opinions typically take 1-2 years. Ruling will determine if Mercosur deal can proceed as structured.

## Significance

### Constitutional Court Function
- Interprets EU "constitution" (treaties)
- Defines EU vs member state powers
- Rulings shape EU integration

### Competence Arbiter
Court decides boundaries between:
- EU exclusive competence (EU acts alone)
- Shared competence (EU and states both act)
- National competence (states only)

Central to trade policy disputes - determines who gets to decide.

### Supremacy Doctrine
Court established that EU law takes precedence over national law (Costa v ENEL, 1964). Controversial in some member states.

## Notable Cases

| Case | Year | Significance |
|------|------|--------------|
| Van Gend en Loos | 1963 | Direct effect - individuals can invoke EU law |
| Costa v ENEL | 1964 | EU law supremacy over national law |
| Cassis de Dijon | 1979 | Mutual recognition in single market |
| Opinion 2/15 | 2017 | Trade agreement competence division |
