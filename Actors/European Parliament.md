## Decision-Making

### Voting Thresholds
- **Simple majority**: Most votes (of those present)
- **Absolute majority**: 50%+1 of all MEPs (361) - required for key decisions
- **Two-thirds majority**: Constitutional matters, censure motions

### Coalition Dynamics
No single group has majority. Legislation typically requires:
- EPP + S&D "grand coalition" (traditional)
- Or EPP + Renew + S&D
- Or ad hoc majorities (as seen in Mercosur vote: Greens + Left + far-right)

## Relationship with Other Institutions

### European Commission
- Elects Commission President (nominated by Council)
- Approves entire College of Commissioners
- Can force Commission resignation via censure (never used successfully)

### Council of the EU
- Co-legislator on most matters
- Consent required for treaties, trade deals
- Often in trilogue negotiations with Council + Commission

### European Council
- No formal relationship
- Receives European Council President reports

## Trade Policy Role

### Consent Procedure
Parliament must consent to trade agreements but cannot amend them. Binary choice: approve or reject.

### Court Referrals
Can request Court of Justice opinion on whether agreement is compatible with EU treaties - as done with [[EU-Mercosur FTA]] (January 2026).

### Mixed vs EU-Only Agreements
- **Mixed agreements**: Touch member state competences → also need 27 national parliament approvals
- **EU-only agreements**: Exclusive EU competence → Council + Parliament only
- The [[Lisbon Treaty]] defines which competences are exclusive vs shared

## Significance

### Democratic Legitimacy
Only directly elected EU body. Critics argue it's still weak compared to national parliaments (no legislative initiative, limited budget control).

### Increasing Power
Each treaty reform has expanded Parliament's role:
- Maastricht (1993): Co-decision introduced
- Amsterdam (1999): Co-decision expanded
- Lisbon (2009): Co-decision becomes "ordinary legislative procedure," covers most areas

### Current Tensions
- Trade policy: Parliament asserting oversight (Mercosur referral)
- Commission relations: Censure motion threatened over Mercosur (January 2026)
- Democratic deficit debates continue
