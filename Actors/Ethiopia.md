# Ethiopia

## Overview
Africa's second-most populous country with ancient civilization and unique non-colonial history. Strategic Horn of Africa location. Recently emerged from devastating civil war (Tigray). Rising power facing internal ethnic tensions and regional rivalries.

## Key Facts
- **Capital**: Addis Ababa (AU headquarters)
- **Population**: ~132 million (2nd in Africa, largest landlocked country in the world)
- **GDP**: ~$155 billion (PPP much higher)
- **PM**: Abiy Ahmed (2018-present, Nobel Peace Prize 2019)
- **Unique**: Never colonized (except brief Italian occupation)

## Geopolitical Position

### Regional Significance
- Horn of Africa anchor
- AU headquarters host
- Landlocked (port access critical)
- Nile waters upstream
- Regional mediator (historically)

### Strategic Location
- Red Sea proximity
- Gulf of Aden access need
- Djibouti port dependence
- Eritrea peace (2018, fragile)
- Somalia border

## Tigray War (2020-2022)

### Background
- TPLF vs. federal government
- Ethnic federalism tensions
- Abiy's centralization
- November 2020 outbreak

### Devastation
- Hundreds of thousands killed
- Millions displaced
- Famine conditions
- War crimes allegations (all sides)
- Infrastructure destruction

### Cessation of Hostilities (Nov 2022)
- Pretoria Agreement
- Fragile peace
- Humanitarian access
- Disarmament (partial)
- Reconciliation challenges

## Ethnic Politics

### Federal System
- Ethnic-based regions
- Tensions between groups
- Oromo, Amhara, Tigray, Somali, etc.
- Centralization vs. autonomy debates

### Current Tensions (as of February 2026)
- **Amhara/Fano insurgency**: Two largest factions unified into AFNM (January 2026); Eritrea accused of funding and arming
- **Oromia/OLA**: Continues despite partial 2024 peace deal; UN: 3.2 million children out of school
- **Tigray re-escalation**: Federal forces moved toward Tigray (February 2026); skirmishes and drone strikes; Tigray admin rejected election suspension as "direct attack on our people" (February 25, 2026)
- Abiy believes Eritrea (and behind it, Egypt) is fueling all three insurgencies
- See: [[Ethiopia-Eritrea Crisis]]

## "Two Waters" Doctrine

Abiy frames Ethiopia's Nile and Red Sea challenges as a single geopolitical problem. Egypt has historically used Eritrea and Red Sea access denial as leverage over the Nile, dating back to Egyptian sponsorship of Eritrean separatists in the 1950s to prevent Ethiopian dam-building. The Red Sea controls access to Cairo's other economic lifeline, Suez. Any resolution likely requires a package deal addressing both water rights and sea access simultaneously.

### Red Sea Access Campaign
- Landlocked since Eritrean independence (1993); dependent on Djibouti
- Signed MOU with Somaliland (January 2024) for 20 km coastline lease and naval base near Berbera — paused under regional pressure
- Built permanent naval headquarters and training facilities in Addis Ababa (2025); graduated first cohort of naval officers
- Signed naval cooperation agreement with Russia
- Sought access to Eritrea's port of Assab — categorically rejected by Eritrea
- Backed down from Somaliland deal after Somalia threatened to expel Ethiopian AMISOM troops; Ethiopia has 6 million ethnic Somalis near the border

- Sudan caught between
- Negotiations stalled
- Filling ongoing

### Implications
- Egypt security concerns
- Regional tensions
- Development vs. water rights
- Climate change factor

## Key Relationships

### Eritrea
- Historic enemy → peace (2018) → Tigray war ally (2020-2022) → open hostility (2025-)
- Eritrea now tactically allied with TPLF faction against federal government
- Port of Assab: Ethiopia demands access; Eritrea categorically refuses
- ICG: Ethiopia-Eritrea one of "Ten Conflicts to Watch in 2026"
- See: [[Ethiopia-Eritrea Crisis]]

### Egypt
- Nile tensions
- Historical rivalry
- GERD disputes
- Potential flashpoint

### United States
