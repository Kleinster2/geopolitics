# JD Vance

## Overview
50th Vice President of the United States (2025-). Iraq War veteran who returned a sharp critic of foreign military interventions. Senator from Ohio (2023-2025). Author of *Hillbilly Elegy* (2016). Core figure in "America First" populist-nationalist wing of Republican Party.

## Background
- **Born**: 1984, Middletown, Ohio
- **Military**: US Marine Corps, Iraq War veteran
- **Education**: Ohio State, Yale Law School
- **Career**: Venture capital, author, Senator (Ohio 2023-2025)

## Foreign Policy Views

### Stated Position
- Iraq War critic—argues Washington policymakers lose sight of American interests in faraway wars
- Skeptical of US interventions and "forever wars"
- Aligned with restraint-oriented Republicans (Hawley, Paul wing)
- Sen. Jim Banks (R-IN): Both he and Vance "served in wars that were poorly run and managed by the military leaders of the prior administrations"

### Reported Private Reservations
Per leaked Signal chat with Trump Cabinet officials (originally about Houthi strikes):
- "I think we are making a mistake"
- "I just hate bailing Europe out again"
- "I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself"

Rebecca Lissner (former Harris deputy NSA) noted Vance was "still relitigating" after Trump had decided, rather than rallying the team.

### Analyst Assessments
Ben Freeman (Quincy Institute): "If JD Vance himself were president, would Venezuela have happened? Would we have captured Maduro? To me, without a doubt, the answer is no."

Some allies see him "struggling to thread the needle" between supporting Trump and not alienating the GOP's anti-interventionist wing.

## Venezuela Intervention (January 2026)

Despite history of intervention skepticism, Vance publicly supported [[Venezuela|Operation Absolute Resolve]]:

- Cast **tie-breaking vote** (50-50) to kill War Powers Resolution (January 14, 2026)
- Posted on X after Maduro capture: "Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says"
- Stated operation was justified as Maduro was wanted in US
- Reported closely involved in planning despite not attending key briefing

Pattern: Private reservations, public support for Trump's decisions.
