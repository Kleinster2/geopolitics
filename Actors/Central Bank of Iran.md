# Central Bank of Iran (Bank Markazi)

## Overview
Iran's central bank, responsible for monetary policy, currency management, and bank supervision. Under severe pressure from sanctions, forced to finance government deficits through money printing, contributing to the rial's collapse and hyperinflation.

## Key Facts
- **Persian name**: بانک مرکزی ایران (Bank Markazi Iran)
- **Established**: 1960
- **Headquarters**: Tehran
- **Current Governor**: Abdolnasser Hemmati (appointed January 2026)
- **Previous Governor**: Mohammad Reza Farzin (resigned)

## Functions
- Monetary policy
- Currency (rial) management
- Foreign exchange reserves
- Bank supervision and regulation
- Government banker

## Current Crisis

### Leadership Change (January 2026)
Governor Mohammad Reza Farzin resigned amid the [[Iranian Economic Crisis]]. Abdolnasser Hemmati, a former economics minister, appointed as replacement—his second stint as governor.

### Key Challenges
| Challenge | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Rial collapse | Lost 84% in 2025 |
| Inflation | 72% food price inflation |
| Bank failures | Ayandeh collapsed, 5 others fragile |
| Sanctions | Cut off from SWIFT, assets frozen |
| Reserves | Depleted, inaccessible |

### Money Printing
CBI forced to finance government deficits through money creation:
- Government cannot borrow internationally (sanctions)
- Tax revenue inadequate
- Oil revenue restricted
- Result: Print money → inflation → rial collapse

### Ayandeh Assessment
CBI official described [[Ayandeh Bank]] collapse as "a Ponzi scheme"—rare public admission of systemic banking fraud.

## Sanctions

### Targeted Directly
The CBI itself is sanctioned by the United States:
- Assets frozen in US jurisdiction
- Cannot transact in dollars
- Cut off from correspondent banking
- Limits ability to defend rial

### SWIFT Access
Iranian banks including CBI largely cut off from SWIFT international payment system, severely limiting international transactions.

## Foreign Exchange

### Reserves
- Officially claims reserves, but much inaccessible due to sanctions
- Cannot freely intervene in currency markets
- Some reserves held in China, India (restricted use)

### Multiple Exchange Rates
Iran maintains multiple exchange rates:
- Official rate (fictional)
- NIMA rate (for importers)
- Free market rate (reality)

Gap between official and market rates reflects dysfunction.

## Historical Context

### Pre-Revolution
Functional central bank integrated into international system.

### Post-1979
Increasingly isolated, especially after:
- 1979: US sanctions begin
- 2012: SWIFT cutoff (Obama era)
- 2018: Maximum pressure (Trump 1.0)
- 2025: Continued isolation
