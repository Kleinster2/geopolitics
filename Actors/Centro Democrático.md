# Centro Democrático

Colombian right-wing political party founded by former president Álvaro Uribe Vélez in 2013. Dominant opposition force during Petro presidency but experiencing severe internal crisis ahead of 2026 elections.

## Overview

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Founded | 2013 |
| Founder | Álvaro Uribe Vélez |
| Ideology | Conservatism, *uribismo*, security-focused |
| Position | Right-wing opposition |

## Core Doctrine

Party founded on principles of:
- **Seguridad Democrática** (Democratic Security) - Uribe's counterinsurgency policy
- Investor confidence
- Social cohesion
- State austerity
- Popular dialogue

## 2025-2026 Crisis

### Wave of Resignations

Party experiencing significant departures over closed congressional list disputes:

**José Félix Lafaurie** (January 2026)
- President of Fedegán (cattle ranchers federation)
- Husband of Senator María Fernanda Cabal
- Party co-founder
- Cited "no space" for his sector; questioned candidate selection

**María Fernanda Cabal**
- Senator, departed with husband Lafaurie
- Leaked chats between Lafaurie and Uribe revealed internal tensions

**Miguel Uribe Londoño** (December 2025)
- Expelled after exclusion from presidential pre-candidate list
- Party claimed his behavior was "imploding" internal process

**Andrés Guerra Hoyos** (November 2025)
- Resigned presidential pre-candidacy
- Focused on Senate seat amid fragmentation

### Presidential Pre-Candidates

Internal poll to determine nominee among:
- María Fernanda Cabal (departed)
- Paloma Valencia (~6% in national polls)
- Paola Holguín

### Uribe's Senate Bid

Álvaro Uribe positioned #25 on closed Senate list. Analysts warn this risks his seat—party may need 3+ million votes for Uribe to win directly. Some candidates offering to resign their positions to ensure his entry.

### Coalition Uncertainty

Uribe warned Centro Democrático might skip March 2026 inter-party opposition consultation if true unification not achieved. Party may instead support single candidate selection via polling.

## Political Context

Crisis coincides with [[Abelardo de la Espriella]]'s rise, who is absorbing right-wing support from:
- Creemos (Fico Gutiérrez)
- Cambio Radical (Char family)
- Salvación Nacional

Centro Democrático's fragmentation potentially benefits de la Espriella's consolidation of far-right vote.
