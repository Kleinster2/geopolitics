## Trump 2.0 (2025-2026)

### Domestic Popularity Decline

According to Maurício Moura (George Washington University, electoral specialist), Trump entered his second term with ~50% approval but lost 10-12 percentage points within one year—historically significant for any president, especially in a second term.

**Three factors driving decline (per Moura):**

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Federal workforce disruption** | DOGE-style cuts sent "many people from the federal government" home; not a campaign promise; spread pain across multiple states (federal workers distributed nationally) |
| **Immigration enforcement excess** | Promised to deport criminals but actions went "far beyond" campaign pledges; lost Hispanic/Latino voter support that had shifted to Trump in 2024 |
| **Tariffs and cost of living** | Americans "paying the price" of tariffs; echoes 2024 campaign theme that hurt Biden |

**Electoral warning signs (2025 elections):**
- Democrats won gubernatorial races in Virginia (Abigail Spanberger) and New Jersey with larger margins than Kamala Harris achieved in 2024
- New York maintained Democratic control
- Georgia local elections trended Democratic
- Common theme: cost of living messaging

**Moura's assessment:** If evaluated by standard polling metrics, "this would be terribly punitive" for Republicans in 2026 midterms.

### Structural Factors Complicating 2026 Midterms

Despite poor approval ratings, outcome uncertain due to:
- **Redistricting**: Texas and other states redrawing districts to favor Republicans
- **Concentration**: Moura estimates only 10-12 congressional districts will be truly competitive
- **Resource focus**: Expect unprecedented pressure on swing districts

### Operational Tempo
Since Christmas 2025, US conducted strikes in:
- **Nigeria** - One-and-done
- **Somalia** - One-and-done
- **Syria** - One-and-done
- **Venezuela** - Operation Absolute Resolve (Maduro captured)
- **Yemen** - Multi-week campaign against Houthis (inconclusive)

Pattern: Quick, decisive strikes with no ground commitment. Trump avoids anything protracted.

### Policy Debates
Internal Republican split on foreign policy:

| Faction | Key Figures | Position |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Interventionist** | Marco Rubio | Muscular support for allies, pressure adversaries |
| **Restrainer** | JD Vance, Tucker Carlson | Focus on China, avoid Middle East entanglements |
| **Transactional** | Trump himself | Encompasses both, decides in the moment |

**Think Tank Positions (Compass Points, Jan 2026):**

| Think Tank | Representative | Core Argument |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| **[[Heritage Foundation]]** | Victoria Coates | Targeted strikes change battlefield dynamics; allies must increase capabilities; Venezuela was linchpin for drug flows |
| **[[AEI]]** | Kori Schake | Values matter for voluntary cooperation; threatening allies makes everything costlier; tactical elegance must connect to strategic objectives |
| **Defense Priorities** | Jennifer Kavanagh | US should pull back from Europe; Russia not major threat to US; military power inappropriate for law enforcement challenges |

**Key Debate: Values vs Power**
- Stephen Miller: "We live in a world governed by strength, force, power"
- Schake response: No dominant power has had as much voluntary assistance as US post-1945—values matter
- Kavanagh response: Might has always made right; values-based foreign policy doesn't serve US interests

### Four-Theater Framework (Coates Analysis)
Victoria Coates (Heritage) argues 2025 NSS identifies 4 theaters requiring attention:
1. **Indo-Pacific** - China competition (primary long-term)
2. **Europe** - Russia/NATO
3. **Middle East** - Iran, Israel
4. **Western Hemisphere** - New focus (per Coates: "not a major component in 2017 NSS, front and center in 2025")

Heritage's Index of Military Strength first addressed Western Hemisphere as national security threat two years ago—initially opposed by military brass who insisted "Europe, Middle East, Indo-Pacific."

### Unpredictability
- No coherent strategic doctrine
- Threatens NATO allies ([[Greenland Crisis]])
- Sets red lines then seeks off-ramps ([[Iran Protests 2025-2026]])
- Military assets constantly repositioned (carriers moved Venezuela→Middle East→Western Pacific)

### Military Overstretch
USS Gerald Ford went to Venezuela, leaving Middle East without nearby carrier strike group. When Iran crisis escalated, USS Abraham Lincoln had to transit from Western Pacific. Drones also repositioned away from Middle East.

### Attacks on Federal Reserve Independence

Trump campaign explicitly promised to end Fed independence (per Moura, who attended both 2024 conventions). Now implementing:

**Roberto Dumas (Insper economist) analysis:**
- Trump demanding 1% interest rates with inflation at 2.7%—"economically nonsensical"
- Cites historical precedent: Arthur Burns (Nixon-era Fed chair) cut rates before 1973-74 election at Nixon's request, leading to 10-11% inflation
- References Kydland-Prescott (2004 Nobel laureates) on "time inconsistency"—governments promising low inflation then delivering higher inflation to boost short-term growth

**Why this matters globally (Dumas):**
- Unlike Turkey or Argentina, US Treasury securities are the global pricing benchmark
- If Fed independence compromised, "you no longer know how to price corporate and government bonds around the world"
- Not a domestic issue—affects global financial architecture

**Jerome Powell response:** Resisting publicly. Some Republican senators working behind scenes to get Trump to back off.

### Domestic Deployment Threats
Threatening to invoke [[Insurrection Act]] against anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis. DOJ investigating Minnesota governor and Minneapolis mayor. Would allow active-duty military to conduct arrests—unprecedented since civil rights era.
