## US-China Competition (2025-2026)

### Bipartisan Consensus

According to Maurício Moura (George Washington University, electoral specialist), China is one of the "very few unifying themes" in Washington:

**Democratic voters:** See China as national security threat—cybersecurity, industrial espionage, "not playing by the rules of international trade law."

**Republican/MAGA voters:** Associate China with job losses, factory closures. "If there's very little consensus in Washington today, it's about the danger of China."


### Technology Competition (Roberto Dumas Analysis)

**Semiconductor controls:**
- Biden's Foreign Direct Product Rule continued and expanded under Trump
- Prohibits export of advanced chips to China
- Xi Jinping's 2025 National People's Congress made clear: China no longer wants to be "sweat shop"—wants AI supremacy

**Rare earths countermeasure:**
- China controls rare earth supply chains
- Responded to chip export controls by restricting rare earth exports to US
- Value: small (~$100 million), but critical for US automotive industry
- Leverage point: "That's where he [Trump] struck a deal"

**AI competition:** Per Dumas, both countries now view AI supremacy as the central strategic competition. The "fight is now completely focused on artificial intelligence."

### Tariff War Dynamics

China was only country to escalate fully against Trump tariffs (per Felipe Loureiro, USP):
- Went "to the last consequences" rather than negotiate
- Trump ultimately "receded significantly"
- Rare earth leverage demonstrated Chinese counter-capability
- "Very clear capacity of China, through rare earths, to place an obstacle" to US tariff war

### Taiwan Ambiguity Restored

- Biden broke decades of "strategic ambiguity" by stating US would send troops if China invaded Taiwan
- Trump restored ambiguity: "We'll see what we'll do"

### Venezuela Response

China's reaction to Maduro capture:
- Issued formal protest, demanded Maduro's release
- No substantive action taken
- Priorities remain Pacific Rim, Taiwan

### Latin American Influence

US concern: China filling vacuum left by US tariff pressure:
- Brazil: 6% increase in exports to China as US exports fell 6%
- More than 1/3 of Brazilian exports to China
- Washington views Brazil partly through lens of Chinese influence
