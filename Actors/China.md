# China

## Overview
The world's most populous country and second-largest economy, pursuing "national rejuvenation" under CCP leadership. Primary strategic competitor to US-led order, with growing global economic and military reach.

## Key Facts
- **Capital**: Beijing
- **Population**: ~1.4 billion
- **GDP**: ~$18 trillion (PPP: ~$30 trillion)
- **Military Budget**: ~$225 billion (official; likely higher)
- **Nuclear Warheads**: ~600 (rapidly expanding; DoD projects 1,000+ by 2030)
- **Leader**: Xi Jinping (General Secretary since 2012)

## Geopolitical Position

### Amphibious Geography

[[Hal Brands]] (February 2026) argues China's strategic geography is uniquely dangerous:

- **Double endowment**: Huge Eurasian hinterland resources + Pacific frontage for oceanic reach
- **When weak**: Assailed by richer enemies from sea while land borders menaced by nomads/rivals
- **When strong**: "Most dangerous sort of country—one that can plausibly seek dominance in two domains"

Xi's strategic gambits reflect this dual geography:
- **Maritime**: Naval buildup, South China Sea militarization, blue-water fleet = reclaiming Ming Dynasty oceanic grandeur
- **Continental**: [[Belt and Road Initiative]] = integrating Eurasia under Chinese economic/political sway

If Beijing succeeds in both domains: "hybrid hegemony" with overwhelming influence on the largest landmass and greatest oceans—ending the American Century.

### Strategic Goals
1. **Taiwan unification**: Core interest, potential flashpoint
2. **Regional primacy**: Dominant position in Asia-Pacific
3. **Belt and Road Initiative**: Global infrastructure/influence
4. **Technology self-sufficiency**: Escape US dependency
5. **Military modernization**: World-class force by 2049

### Core Interests (Non-Negotiable)
- Taiwan
- South China Sea claims
- Tibet, Xinjiang sovereignty
- CCP rule

## Foreign Policy Concepts
- **Wolf Warrior Diplomacy**: Assertive, nationalist posture
- **Dual Circulation**: Domestic + international economic strategy
- **[[Community with a Shared Future]]**: Alternative to Western order

## Territorial Disputes
- **Taiwan**: Claims full sovereignty
- **South China Sea**: Nine-dash line claims
- **East China Sea**: Senkaku/Diaoyu with [[Japan]]
- **India**: LAC border disputes

## Key Relationships

### Partners
- [[Russia]] (strategic partnership)
- [[Pakistan]] (all-weather friendship)
- [[North Korea]] (complicated ally)
- Global South outreach via BRI

### Rivals
- [[United States]] (strategic competition)
- [[Japan]] (historical tensions)
- [[India]] (border disputes)
- [[Australia]] (deteriorated relations)

## Strengths
- Manufacturing dominance
- Population scale
- State capacity for long-term planning
- Technology advancement
- Growing military capabilities

## Vulnerabilities
- **Demographics** (aging population) - see [[China Demographic Decline]]
- Energy import dependence
- Taiwan scenario costs
- Technology chokepoints (semiconductors)
- Real estate/debt issues
- **Military leadership instability** (2024-2026 purges)
- **Heavy rare earth supply fragility**: ~98% of HREE imports came from [[Myanmar Rare Earths|Myanmar's Kachin State]] in 2023; KIO seizure of mines (October 2024) disrupted this supply

## Military Leadership Purges (2024-2026)

### January 2026 Announcement (Confirmed)
On January 24, 2026, China's Ministry of National Defense announced that Zhang Youxia and Liu Zhenli were under investigation for "serious disciplinary and legal violations."

- **Zhang Youxia**: Vice Chairman of Central Military Commission, highest-ranking military official after Xi
- **Liu Zhenli**: CMC member, Chief of Joint Staff Department

### CMC Composition (Confirmed)
Of the seven original members of China's Central Military Commission, five have been purged or removed since 2024. Only two remain:
1. Xi Jinping (Chairman)
2. Miao Hua (promoted October 2025)

Earlier purges included members of the Rocket Force and equipment development departments.

### Analytical Interpretations

**Heng He (Epoch Times)** characterizes this as a "coup" by Xi to reassert control:
- Claims announcement violated normal CCP procedures
- Argues "chain of command is totally broken"
- Views purged generals as professional military opposing premature Taiwan action
- See [[Heng He]] for full framework

**Note**: Claims about internal motivations, power dynamics, and procedure violations are largely unverifiable. The scale of purges (5/7 CMC members) is observable; the reasons are contested.

### Demographic Crisis (2025-2026)

**Official data (NBS, January 2026):**
- Population fell for 4th consecutive year
- 2025: -3.39 million (accelerating from -2.08 million in 2024)
- Births: 7.92 million (lowest since 1949)
- Birth rate: 5.63 per 1,000
- Population over 60: 323 million (23%)

**The overcount debate:**
Some analysts argue official data understates the problem. The Shanghai Academy of Sciences has reportedly discussed population overcounts of 100+ million under age 45.

[[Peter Zeihan]] argues China has "no more than 10 years" before economic model fails due to demographics. This is contested—see [[China Demographic Decline]] for full analysis of claims and counterclaims.

## US-China Competition (2025-2026)

### Bipartisan Consensus

According to Maurício Moura (George Washington University, electoral specialist), China is one of the "very few unifying themes" in Washington:

**Democratic voters:** See China as national security threat—cybersecurity, industrial espionage, "not playing by the rules of international trade law."

**Republican/MAGA voters:** Associate China with job losses, factory closures. "If there's very little consensus in Washington today, it's about the danger of China."


### Technology Competition (Roberto Dumas Analysis)

**Semiconductor controls:**
- Biden's Foreign Direct Product Rule continued and expanded under Trump
- Prohibits export of advanced chips to China
- Xi Jinping's 2025 National People's Congress made clear: China no longer wants to be "sweat shop"—wants AI supremacy

**Rare earths countermeasure:**
- China controls rare earth supply chains (~91% of global processing)
- Responded to chip export controls by restricting rare earth exports to US
- April 2025: Imposed export controls on 7 medium/heavy REEs including dysprosium and terbium
- Value: small (~$100 million), but critical for defense (F-35s require ~920 lbs of rare earths per unit) and automotive industry
- Leverage point: "That's where he [Trump] struck a deal"
- See [[Myanmar Rare Earths]] for China's HREE supply chain vulnerability

**AI competition:** Per Dumas, both countries now view AI supremacy as the central strategic competition. The "fight is now completely focused on artificial intelligence."

### Tariff War Dynamics

China was only country to escalate fully against Trump tariffs (per Felipe Loureiro, USP):
- Went "to the last consequences" rather than negotiate
- Trump ultimately "receded significantly"
- Rare earth leverage demonstrated Chinese counter-capability
- "Very clear capacity of China, through rare earths, to place an obstacle" to US tariff war

### Taiwan Ambiguity Restored

- Biden broke decades of "strategic ambiguity" by stating US would send troops if China invaded Taiwan
- Trump restored ambiguity: "We'll see what we'll do"

### Venezuela Response

China's reaction to Maduro capture:
- Issued formal protest, demanded Maduro's release
- No substantive action taken
- Priorities remain Pacific Rim, Taiwan

### Latin American Influence

US concern: China filling vacuum left by US tariff pressure:
- Brazil: 6% increase in exports to China as US exports fell 6%
- More than 1/3 of Brazilian exports to China
- Washington views Brazil partly through lens of Chinese influence

## Trump-Xi Phone Call (February 4, 2026)

- Trump described as "excellent" and "long and thorough"
- Xi called Taiwan "the most important issue" in China-US relations
- Discussed: trade (soybean purchases of 20-25 million tons), Iran, Russia/Ukraine
- **April 2026 face-to-face summit planned**
- Xi urged US to handle Taiwan arms sales "with great prudence"
