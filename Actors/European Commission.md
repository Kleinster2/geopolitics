# European Commission

## Overview
Executive branch of the [[European Union]]. Proposes legislation, enforces EU law, represents EU internationally, and negotiates trade agreements. Often described as the EU's "government" though it lacks democratic mandate of national executives.

## Key Facts
- **Commissioners**: 27 (one per member state)
- **President**: [[Ursula von der Leyen]] (2019-present, second term from 2024)
- **Staff**: ~32,000 civil servants
- **Headquarters**: Berlaymont building, Brussels

## Powers

### Legislative Initiative
- **Monopoly on proposing EU legislation** - Parliament and Council cannot initiate
- Sets EU agenda through annual work programs
- Can withdraw proposals if Parliament/Council amend beyond recognition

### Executive Functions
- Implements EU budget
- Manages EU programs and funds
- Enforces EU law (can take member states to Court)
- Issues regulations and decisions

### Trade Policy
- **Sole negotiator** of EU trade agreements (on Council mandate)
- Represents EU in WTO
- Proposes trade defense measures (tariffs, anti-dumping)
- Decides agreement structure (EU-only vs mixed)

This last power is central to [[EU-Mercosur FTA]] controversy - Commission decided to "split" the deal.

## Structure

### President
- Nominated by European Council, elected by [[European Parliament]]
- Sets political priorities
- Allocates portfolios to Commissioners
- Can request Commissioner resignation

### College of Commissioners
Each Commissioner heads a Directorate-General (DG):

| Key Portfolio | Commissioner | Relevance |
|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| Trade | Maroš Šefčovič | EU-India, EU-Mercosur negotiations |
| Competition | Teresa Ribera | Tech regulation, state aid |
| Economy | Valdis Dombrovskis | Euro policy |
| Foreign Affairs | Kaja Kallas | High Representative, also VP |

### Directorates-General (DGs)
~40 departments handling policy areas. Key ones:
- DG Trade - trade negotiations
- DG COMP - competition/antitrust
- DG ECFIN - economic policy

## Trade Agreement Process

1. **Council authorization**: Commission requests negotiating mandate
2. **Negotiation**: Commission negotiates on EU's behalf
3. **Initialing**: Technical conclusion of talks
4. **Council approval**: Qualified majority (or unanimity for mixed)
5. **Parliament consent**: Binary yes/no vote
6. **Ratification**: If mixed, also 27 national parliaments

### The "Split Deal" Strategy
Post-[[Lisbon Treaty]], Commission began splitting agreements:
- Trade-only portions → EU-only procedure (faster)
- Investment/other portions → Mixed procedure

This allows bypassing national parliaments on core trade provisions. Used for [[EU-Mercosur FTA]], challenged by [[European Parliament]].

## Accountability

### To Parliament
- Parliament elects Commission President
- Parliament approves entire College
- Parliament can censure (force resignation) - never successfully used
- Commissioners appear before Parliament committees

### To Council
- Council sets negotiating mandates
- Council concludes international agreements
- Council can block Commission proposals

### Democratic Deficit Critique
- Commissioners not directly elected
- Legislative monopoly criticized as undemocratic
- Trade negotiating power seen as technocratic overreach
- "Split deal" strategy seen as bypassing elected national parliaments

## Current Tensions (2026)

### Trade Policy
- [[EU-Mercosur FTA]]: Parliament referred to Court, potential censure motion
- [[EU-India FTA]]: Smooth path, signing January 25-27
- Balancing Trump tariff response with internal divisions

### Institutional Relations
Parliament increasingly assertive against Commission trade authority.
