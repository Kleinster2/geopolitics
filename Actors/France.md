- **Old model**: France = geopolitical power, Germany = economic power
- **New reality**: Germany becoming both, leaving France sidelined
- Germany spending €500 billion on defense by 2029
- France lacks fiscal space to match

- "Schizophrenic" mood: relief Germany doing more, anxiety about being surpassed
- German defense industry threatening French sector dominance
- Political fragility weakening France's geopolitical heft
- Center of European gravity moving east

### FCAS Collapse

- Joint project with Germany (Dassault + Airbus)
- Years of failed negotiations over production share
- Europe's most ambitious defense project "about to fall apart"

### Feeling Excluded
- European Sky Shield Initiative announced without France
- Germany chose US F-35s over European aircraft
- Perception of Germany acting unilaterally despite rhetoric of cooperation

### French Response
