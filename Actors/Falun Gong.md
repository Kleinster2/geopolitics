# Falun Gong

## Overview
Spiritual practice combining meditation, qigong exercises, and moral philosophy based on principles of truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance. Banned by the Chinese Communist Party in 1999 and subject to ongoing persecution. Diaspora practitioners have built significant media and cultural organizations.

## Origins and Growth (1992-1999)
