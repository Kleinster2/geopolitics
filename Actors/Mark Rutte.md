# Mark Rutte

## Overview
Secretary General of [[NATO]] since October 2024. Former Prime Minister of the Netherlands (2010-2024), the longest-serving Dutch PM. Known for pragmatic, transactional approach to diplomacy.

## NATO Role

### Greenland Crisis (January 2026)
Central figure in de-escalating Trump's Greenland threats at Davos:

- Met with Trump to negotiate "framework of a future deal" on Greenland and Arctic security
- Announcement led Trump to drop tariff threats against European allies
- When asked if Greenland remains Danish territory: "That issue did not come up anymore in my conversations tonight."
- Framed discussions around Arctic security and countering Russian/Chinese activity

**Assessment**: The "framework deal" appears to largely restate existing arrangements under the 1951 US-Denmark defense treaty. Rutte's role seems to have been providing Trump a face-saving off-ramp from escalating threats.

### Approach to Trump
Rutte has been characterized as one of few European leaders able to manage Trump through flattery and transactional framing. His pragmatism contrasts with more confrontational European responses.

## Background
- Dutch VVD (liberal) party leader
