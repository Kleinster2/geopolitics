# Defense Priorities

## Overview
Restraint-oriented think tank advocating for a more limited US foreign policy focused on core national security interests. Argues against military interventionism, forward deployment in Europe, and values-based foreign policy.

## Key Facts
- **Founded**: 2016
- **Location**: Washington, DC
- **Orientation**: Restraint / non-interventionism
- **Focus**: Military policy, defense spending, grand strategy

## Core Positions

### On US Force Posture
- US should pull back from Europe
- Europe is rich and can defend itself
- Forward deployment increases risk without proportionate benefit
- "Pivot home" rather than pivot to Asia

### On Threats
- Russia is **not** a major threat to the United States
- China is the most proximate challenge, primarily economic
- Threats in Western Hemisphere are law enforcement issues (drugs, cartels), not military

### On Values
- Values-based foreign policy does not serve US interests
- "Might makes right" has always been true—not new under Trump
- Rejects idea that US post-1945 order was fundamentally different

### On Military Power
- Opposes use of military for law enforcement challenges
- Critical of operations like Venezuela intervention
- Prefers restraint even when intervention might "succeed"

## Key Figures

### Jennifer Kavanagh
- **Position**: Senior Fellow, Director of Military Analysis

## Contrast with Other Think Tanks

| Issue | Defense Priorities | Heritage | AEI |
|-------|-------------------|----------|-----|
| Europe deployment | Pull back | Allies must do more | Stay, values matter |
| Russia threat | Minimal to US | Nuisance if managed | Growing, must deter |
| Values in FP | Reject | Secondary | Essential |
| Venezuela op | Inappropriate use of military | Justified (drug nexus) | Tactically elegant, strategically unclear |

## Intellectual Lineage
- Restraint tradition in US foreign policy
- Skepticism of liberal internationalism
- Realist orientation but distinct from offensive realism
- Shares some ground with left-wing anti-interventionism
