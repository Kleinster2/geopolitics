## Rare Earth Mining

Northern Kachin State contains some of the world's most valuable deposits of heavy rare earth elements (dysprosium, terbium). See [[Myanmar Rare Earths]] for full analysis.

### Key Facts
- Over 370 active mining sites by end of 2024 (per ISP-Myanmar)
- Myanmar supplied approximately 98% of China's heavy rare earth imports in 2023 (per Global Witness)
- USD 4.2 billion in exports to China (2017-2024), 85% after the coup (per ISP-Myanmar)
- World's third-largest rare earth producer (approximately 31,000 metric tons in 2024)

### Control
- Pre-October 2024: Controlled by NDA-K (junta-aligned militia), operated by Chinese companies
- October 2024: [[Kachin Independence Organization]] (KIA) seized all major mining areas
- 2025: KIO renegotiating terms, imposing taxes, formulating regulations
- India began direct engagement with KIO for rare earth access (July 2025)

### Environmental Impact
EarthRights International (April 2025) documented severe environmental destruction: 32,720 hectares of deforestation (2018-2024), water contamination with heavy metals, community health impacts. Described Kachin as a "sacrifice zone for the green transition."

## Strategic Significance

- Strategic access
- Influence maintenance
- **Rare earth supply**: China sources approximately 50% of heavy rare earth inputs from Myanmar

### BRI Projects
- China-Myanmar Economic Corridor
- Kyaukphyu port
- Pipelines operational
- Coup complicated but continued

## Humanitarian Crisis

### Scale
- Millions displaced
- Economic collapse
- Healthcare system broken
- Food insecurity
