## 2026 Presidential Election

Presidential election scheduled for May 31, 2026 (first round); June 21, 2026 (runoff if needed).

### Leading Candidates (January 2026 polling)

| Candidate | Support | Position |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Iván Cepeda | 30-34% | Pacto Histórico (left) |
| [[Abelardo de la Espriella]] | 18-22% | Defensores de la Patria (far-right) |
| Paloma Valencia | ~6% | Centro Democrático (right) |

### Implications

De la Espriella's rise signals potential sharp rightward correction after Petro. His paramilitary background (AUC advisor) and drug amnesty proposal create friction points regardless of outcome. Contest likely to polarize around Petro legacy.

## US-Colombia Crisis and Detente (January 2025 - February 2026)

### Phase 1: Deportation Flights Standoff (January 25-27, 2025)
- Petro refused to accept US military deportation flights
- Trump threatened 25% tariffs escalating to 50%
- Petro counter-threatened 50% tariffs on US goods
- Colombia backed down within 24 hours after FM Murillo announced impasse over

### Phase 2: Escalating Sanctions (March - October 2025)
- **March 2025**: DHS Secretary Noem accused Colombia of harboring Tren de Aragua
- **September 15**: Drug decertification—first time since the 1990s
- **September 26**: Petro's visa revoked after pro-Palestinian speech at UNGA
- **October 19**: Trump declared Petro an "illegal drug leader"
- **October 24**: Treasury placed Petro and family on OFAC/Clinton List with asset freezes
- Context: record coca cultivation (253,000 hectares, 2,664 metric tons potential cocaine production)

### Phase 3: Venezuela Intervention Crisis (January 3-7, 2026)
- Operation Absolute Resolve triggered Petro's deployment of 30,000 troops to Venezuelan border
- Petro: would "take up arms" if necessary (referencing his M-19 past)
- Trump: similar operation in Colombia "sounds good to me"; called Petro a "sick man"
- Colombia braced for up to 1.7 million additional Venezuelan refugees on top of 3 million already hosted

### Phase 4: Rapid Detente (January 7 - February 2026)
- **January 7**: Hour-long Trump-Petro phone call described as "180-degree change"
- Agreed on joint action against the ELN (shared threat)
- Trilateral military planning with post-Maduro Venezuela
- Petro visited Washington on special visa
- **White House meeting**: Nearly two hours; Trump called Petro "terrific"
- Petro delivered **kingpin target list** (Chiquito Malo, Pablito, Iván Mordisco)—a reversal of his "Total Peace" negotiation policy
- Trilateral Ecopetrol-PDVSA-Monomeros energy proposal discussed
- Possible Clinton List removal by mid-2026

**Analytical takeaway**: The Venezuela intervention acted as a strategic reset. The shared ELN threat provided a "common enemy" enabling rapprochement. Petro's willingness to hand over a kingpin list represented an abandonment of core policy.

### Gulf Clan Peace Talks Suspended
The Gulf Clan (AGC) suspended Doha peace talks in response to Petro's pivot toward cooperation with the US, calling the kingpin list a "betrayal." This demonstrates the real cost of the detente for Colombia's Total Peace process.

### Trade Dimension
- $53.5 billion bilateral trade
- Key exports: coffee, flowers, petroleum
- Projected 8% export decline under tariffs
- Agricultural goods eventually exempted from reciprocal tariffs
- Only 10% reciprocal tariffs applied to Colombia (vs 50% on Brazil)

### Fabio Schapiro (Reichman University) Analysis
Commented on i24 News that the Trump-Petro meeting reflected how the Venezuela intervention reshaped the entire hemisphere's relationship with Washington.

## Future Trajectory

- Peace process success?
- Security stabilization?
- US relationship evolution?
- Post-Petro direction?
- 2026 election outcome?
