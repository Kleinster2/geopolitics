# Vladimir Putin

## Overview
President of Russia (2000-2008, 2012-present). Central actor in [[Ukraine Crisis]], [[Alaska Summit 2025]], and source of controversy around the [[Board of Peace]]. Longest-serving Russian leader since Stalin.

## Positions

### Foreign Policy (On-the-Record)
- NATO expansion as existential threat to Russia
- Post-Soviet space as Russian sphere of influence
- Multipolar world order vs. US unipolarity
- Energy as geopolitical leverage (gas pipelines, oil markets)
- Nuclear deterrence as great power guarantee

### Key Actions (Vault-Relevant)
- Invaded Ukraine (February 2022), ongoing war
- [[Alaska Summit 2025]] - Summit with Trump (August 2025)
- Maintained relationships with Orban, Erdogan, Lukashenko during isolation
- Deepened China-Russia alignment post-2022

### Board of Peace
Invited to join. His potential involvement cited by [[Keir Starmer]] as "concerning" given Ukraine invasion. Kremlin stated it "aims to contact US" for details. Putin's inclusion/exclusion became a litmus test for the body's credibility among Western nations.
