## Political Significance

Cepeda represents continuity with Petro government and ideological consolidation of Colombian left. His candidacy frames 2026 as stark left-right choice, particularly against [[Abelardo de la Espriella]]'s far-right campaign.

His human rights background and anti-paramilitary activism create sharp contrast with de la Espriella's AUC ties.
