# Franco-German Relations

## Overview
The "engine" of European integration, now under strain as Germany's historic rearmament upends the traditional division of labor. France provided geopolitical leadership while Germany focused on economic power. Germany now doing both, creating anxiety in Paris about being sidelined.

## Historical Framework

### Post-WWII Settlement
- Franco-German reconciliation as EU foundation
- Germany: Economic giant, political dwarf (by design)
- France: Military power, diplomatic leadership
- Complementary roles stabilized Europe

### Élysée Treaty (1963)
- De Gaulle and Adenauer
- Institutionalized cooperation
- Regular summits
- Youth exchanges
- Defense consultations

## Traditional Division of Labor

| Domain | France | Germany |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Military | Leader | Restrained |
| Nuclear | Yes | No |
| UNSC Seat | Yes | No |
| EU Vision | Political | Economic |
| Defense Industry | Strong | Limited |
| Power Projection | Global | None |

## 2025-2026: Balance Disrupted

### Germany's Historic Rearmament
- €500 billion defense spending by 2029
- Hitting NATO 3.5% GDP target 6 years early
- Abolished borrowing limits for defense
- Unmatched speed and volume in Europe

### French Position
- "Schizophrenic" mood in Paris
- Relief Germany contributing more
- Anxiety about being surpassed
- No fiscal space to match spending
- Political fragility domestically

### Shift in Power
- Germany becoming both economic AND military power
- European center of gravity moving east
- Germany positioned for "strategic enablers" role
- France risks marginalization

## Points of Friction

### FCAS (Future Combat Air System)
- 6th-generation fighter program
- Dassault (France) vs Airbus (Germany)
- Years of failed negotiations
- Production share disputes unresolved
- Project "about to fall apart"

### European Sky Shield Initiative
- German-led missile defense project
- France felt excluded from design
- Unilateral German announcement
- Symbolizes communication breakdown

### Equipment Choices
- Germany bought US F-35 instead of European aircraft
- French perception of betrayal
- Questions about "strategic autonomy" commitment
- Under Merz: US purchases slowing

### Leadership Style
- Germany more assertive under Merz
- France struggling with domestic politics
- Different threat perceptions (France global, Germany Russia-focused)
- Industrial competition intensifying

## AfD Factor
- German far-right at record polling
- European concern about German military if nationalists govern
- Could French nuclear deterrent become Europe's umbrella?
- Questions about reliability of German commitments

## Cooperation Areas (Remaining)

### Joint Institutions
- Franco-German Defense Council
- Franco-German Brigade
- Airbus (civilian, some defense)
- Joint diplomatic initiatives

### Shared Interests
- European integration
- Russia deterrence
- Strategic autonomy concept
- Industrial base preservation

## Future Scenarios

### Managed Competition
- Continued friction but partnership survives
- Division of labor renegotiated
- Joint projects on smaller scale
- EU framework constrains rivalry

### Franco-German Rift
- FCAS collapses entirely
- Defense industries compete openly
- EU defense fragmented
- NATO becomes primary framework

### German Leadership
- France accepts secondary role
- Germany dominant in European defense
- French nuclear umbrella discussions
- Fundamental rebalancing
