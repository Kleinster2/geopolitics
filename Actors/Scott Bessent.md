# Scott Bessent

## Overview
US Treasury Secretary in the Trump 2.0 administration. Former hedge fund manager, founder of Key Square Group. Previously worked at Soros Fund Management.

## Policy Positions

### On Greenland
At Davos (January 2026):
- Said Trump "believes that Greenland is essential for the Golden Dome Missile Shield"
- Called Denmark "irrelevant" - dismissive of a NATO ally that had the highest per capita death rate of coalition countries in Afghanistan

### On Europe
Part of Trump administration's confrontational posture toward European allies at Davos. His dismissive comments about Denmark reflect broader administration view of European allies as expendable.

## Significance
Initially seen by some as a potential "adult in the room" who might moderate Trump's economic policies. His Davos performance suggests he is instead amplifying rather than tempering the administration's approach to allies.

Per Ed Luce (Financial Times): "Our definition of an adult is way way lower than it was in 1.0... Scott Bessent has I think very undeservedly been defined by many as the adult in the room. In fact, he's just another part of the Greek chorus that is doing so much damage to relations with allies."
