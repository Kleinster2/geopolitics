# Council of the European Union

## Overview
Legislative body representing EU member state governments. Together with [[European Parliament]], forms EU's bicameral legislature. Not to be confused with European Council (heads of state/government) or Council of Europe (separate organization).

Also called: "Council of Ministers" or simply "the Council."

## Key Facts
- **Members**: Government ministers from each of 27 member states
- **Presidency**: Rotates every 6 months among member states
- **Headquarters**: Justus Lipsius building, Brussels
- **Current Presidency**: Poland (January-June 2026)

## How It Works

### Configurations
No fixed membership - different ministers attend depending on topic:

| Configuration | Who Attends | Handles |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Foreign Affairs | Foreign ministers | CFSP, external relations |
| Economic and Financial (ECOFIN) | Finance ministers | Economic policy, budget |
| General Affairs | Europe ministers | Institutional, horizontal issues |
| Agriculture | Agriculture ministers | CAP, food policy |
| Trade | Trade ministers | Trade agreements, WTO |

### Voting Rules

| Type | Threshold | Used For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Simple majority** | 14 of 27 states | Procedural matters |
| **Qualified majority (QMV)** | 55% of states (15) representing 65% of EU population | Most legislation |
| **Unanimity** | All 27 | Tax, foreign policy, new members, treaty changes |

The 65% population requirement prevents large states from being outvoted by many small ones, and vice versa.

### Blocking Minority
At least 4 states representing 35% of population can block QMV decisions.

## Powers

### Legislative
- Co-legislator with Parliament (ordinary legislative procedure)
- Can amend Commission proposals (unanimously to override Commission objection)
- Final say on some policies (unanimity areas)

### Trade Agreements
- Authorizes Commission to negotiate (gives mandate)
- Approves final agreements (QMV for trade-only, unanimity if mixed)
- Can reject deals Commission negotiates

### EU-Mercosur Vote (January 9, 2026)
First non-unanimous trade agreement vote:

| Vote | Countries |
|------|-----------|
| **For (21)** | Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, + 17 others |
| **Against (5)** | Austria, France, Hungary, Ireland, Poland |
| **Abstain (1)** | Belgium |

Despite opposition from major states including France, qualified majority achieved.

## Relationship with Other Bodies

### European Council
- European Council (heads of state) sets strategic direction
- Council (ministers) does legislative work
- Different bodies, easily confused

### European Commission
- Commission proposes, Council disposes
- Council gives Commission negotiating mandates
- Council concludes international agreements

### European Parliament
- Co-equal on most legislation
- Parliament cannot amend Council positions directly
- Trilogue negotiations reconcile differences

## Significance

### Member State Voice
Council ensures national governments represented in EU decisions. Ministers accountable to national parliaments.

### Unanimity Areas
Some policy areas still require all 27 to agree:
- Foreign and security policy
- Taxation
- EU membership
- Treaty changes

This gives each state veto power on sensitive issues.

### Trade Policy Tension
[[EU-Mercosur FTA]] showed limits of QMV - France and others outvoted but deal still faces legal challenge. Tension between efficiency (QMV) and legitimacy (unanimity/national parliaments).
