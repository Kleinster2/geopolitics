## US Military Intervention (January 3, 2026)

### Operation Absolute Resolve
- **2:00 AM local time**: US bombed air defenses across northern Venezuela
- Apprehension force attacked Maduro's compound in Caracas
- **Maduro and wife Cilia Flores captured**
- Transported to New York City by US forces
- Zero US casualties
- Closest parallel: Panama 1989 (Noriega capture)

### Legal Framing
- Maduro and Flores indicted on **narcoterrorism charges**
- Pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court (Jan 5)
- Trump: "inherent constitutional authority" for operation
- Trump explicitly cited **oil access** as core reason
- Chatham House: "significant violation of Venezuelan sovereignty"

### Walt's Analysis: The Real Reasons
[[Stephen Walt]] argues the stated justifications don't hold:

> "It's not primarily about narcotics, because Venezuela is not a major drug source. It's not about the regime itself, because you've now left the old regime in place. It's not about anything they've done that threatens anyone's security."

**What it's really about:**
- Putting Latin America on notice: "This is our hemisphere and we're going to run it"
- [[Monroe Doctrine]] enforcement
- Demonstrating US dominance in Western Hemisphere
- Example of [[Predatory Hegemony]] extending to entire region
- Message: resistance will not be tolerated

### Aftermath in Venezuela
- **Acting President**: Delcy Rodríguez (Maduro's handpicked lieutenant)
- Interior minister and defense minister left in place
- Rodríguez: "There is only one president - Nicolás Maduro"
- 68 political prisoners released (of 800+ held)
- Trump: "US is in charge of Venezuela"

**Reality on the Ground (January 2026):**
- Security services of Maduro government still running Venezuela
- State Department warning: "No American is safe in Venezuela"
- Regime reestablishing terror networks
- Terror networks that kept Maduro in power remain operational
- AG Barr worked on Maduro indictments back in 2020—this is not new

### Nobel Prize Incident
[[María Corina Machado]] gave Trump her **physical Nobel Peace Prize medal** as a gesture of gratitude:
- Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize (exact date TBD)
- Presented the actual medal to Trump at the White House
- Trump appeared to conflate having the medal with being a laureate
- Nobel Committee clarified: prizes cannot be transferred; recipient remains the laureate
- Trump has long desired Nobel recognition (resented Obama receiving one "after just a few weeks")
- Teddy Roosevelt's 1906 Nobel medal is displayed elsewhere in the White House

### International Reactions
| Response | Countries |
|----------|-----------|
| **Condemned** | Brazil, Spain, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, China |
| **Supported** | NATO members, most of Europe/North America |
| **China** | Demands immediate release of Maduro |

### Regional Response
- Brazil: Joint communiqué expressing "deep concern"
- Minimal action beyond careful words
- Latin America exposed as geopolitically impotent
- Brazil and Cuba "biggest losers" from reshuffle

### Why It Happened
- Brazil spent years misreading the crisis
- Lula enabled Maduro (May 2023 red carpet visit)
- Regional institutions failed to respond to authoritarian drift
- "Respect for sovereignty" used to mask indifference
- US felt emboldened by regional paralysis

### Implications
- End of US reluctance to intervene in Western Hemisphere
- Death of Latin American "non-intervention" norm
- Brazil's UNSC ambitions damaged
- BRICS, Global South rhetoric exposed as hollow
- First capture of sitting head of state since Noriega

### Strategic Critique
Kori Schake (AEI) argues tactical elegance doesn't connect to strategic objectives:
- Not regime change (same people in power)
- Not assisting democratic transition
- Story keeps shifting about objectives
- Clock ticking as regime reestablishes control

Jennifer Kavanagh (Defense Priorities) notes:
- Threats in Western Hemisphere are drugs/cartels—law enforcement challenges
- Military power was inappropriate tool
- Once Maduro gone, keeping regime preferable to De-Ba'athification repeat (Iraq lesson)

Victoria Coates (Heritage) defends approach:
- Trump gave Maduro nearly a year of engagement first
- Venezuela identified as linchpin for drug/cartel flows
- Law enforcement operation using existing institutions for orderly transition

## Future Scenarios (Post-Intervention)

### Challenges
- Nation-building complexity
- Venezuelan institutional capacity
- Economic reconstruction
- Refugee returns
- Regional relations

## Lessons

### Sanctions Limits
- Regime adaptation
- Civilian suffering
- Limited leverage
- Alternative partners

### Authoritarian Resilience
- Survival mechanisms
- External support
- Repression capacity
- Economic extraction
