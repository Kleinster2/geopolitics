## Key Relationships

### United States

**Overview:**
- Largest LA partner but periodic tensions
- Trade relationship (US is superavitary with Brazil)
- Bolsonaro alignment (past)
- Lula's independence
- Amazon disagreements

**Trump 2.0 Relations (2025-2026):**

*Bolsonaro:* Despite lobbying from Eduardo Bolsonaro and Paulo Figueiredo, Trump did not intervene on Jair Bolsonaro's behalf. Bolsonaro was tried and imprisoned.

*Lula:* Trump engaged personally with Lula in weeks before Venezuela operation.

**Tariff Negotiations (2025):**

Maurício Moura (George Washington University): "In practice, what we saw in Washington was that the **Brazilian private sector acted directly with the White House** on the tariff episode."

| Sector | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Aviation | Lobbied directly |
| Coffee | Pressure led to tariff reduction |
| Meat | Sector engaged with DC lobbyists |

**Paradigm shift:** Previously, trade negotiations occurred state-to-state through diplomatic channels. Trump's tariff policy opened new era where private sectors organize to lobby the White House directly—both American sectors hurt by tariffs and foreign (Brazilian) sectors affected.

*Moura's assessment:* Brazilian business lobby had "very large weight" in preventing worse outcomes.

**Ongoing concerns (Felipe Loureiro, USP):**
- Tariff situation "improved but still preoccupying"
- Substantial Brazilian exports still face 10% base tariff or 40-50% aggregate tariffs (especially manufactures)
- Recent Trump threat: 25% additional tariff on countries doing business with Iran (Brazil has small grain exports to Iran)

### China

**Trade relationship:**
- Top trading partner
- Commodity exports (soy, iron ore)
- BRI interest
- Technology (Huawei)
- Strategic partnership
- More than 1/3 of Brazilian exports go to China

**2025-2026 Tariff War Effects (Roberto Dumas, Insper):**
- Brazil's trade balance: $68 billion (down 8% overall)
- Exports to US: down 6%
- Exports to China: **up 6%**
- Pattern: China absorbing trade displaced from US

**US perspective (Dumas):** Washington views Brazil partly through lens of Chinese influence. China "uses Brazil as a weapon" in negotiations with US. Trump administration aware that over a third of Brazilian exports flow to China

## Venezuela Crisis: Brazil's Foreign Policy Failure (2026)

### US Intervention Exposes Brazil
- Trump removed Maduro in "matter of hours" - zero casualties
- US effectively installed protectorate on Brazil's 2,200 km border
- Brazil's response: joint communiqué expressing "deep concern"
- Exposed as geopolitically impotent despite size
- "Biggest loser" alongside Cuba from reshuffle

### How Brazil Failed
| Year | Action | Consequence |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 2010s | Misread Venezuela crisis | Authoritarian entrenchment |
| May 2023 | Lula hosted Maduro, dismissed dictatorship talk | Enabled regime |
| 2024 | Failed to act on stolen election | Legitimized fraud |
| 2026 | Minimal response to US intervention | Regional irrelevance |

### The Critique (Acemoglu-style)
- Invested in "toothless" BRICS, Global South rhetoric
- Neglected basic leadership: keeping neighborhood in order
- Used "sovereignty" to mask indifference to authoritarian drift
- Partisan foreign policy over democratic principles
- Even Norway, Qatar had more credibility as mediators

### Lula Boxed In
- Trump made peace with Lula weeks before operation
- Can't confront Washington without jeopardizing détente
- Focused on EU-Mercosur deal instead
- Restraining anti-American rhetoric
- "Salutary lesson in pragmatism"

### Implications for Brazil
- UNSC permanent seat aspirations damaged
- Regional leadership credibility shattered
- Now bystander to nation-building on own border
- Must return to defending democracy vs. enabling autocrats
- Strategic non-alignment risks increased

### Expert View
> "Brazil has not only lost influence and coordination capacity in the region; the risks of strategic non-alignment vis-à-vis Washington have also increased. It is in Brazil's own interest to show that multilateralism needs reform, including at the UN Security Council."
> — Bruna Santos, Director, Brazil Program, Inter-American Dialogue

### Prescription
Return to traditional strengths:
1. Defending democracy (not enabling regimes)
2. Pushing for meaningful international reform
3. Multilateralism that means something
4. Regional coordination capacity
