## Positions

- **Director-General, Board of Peace** (January 2026-present)

### United Nations
- **Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process** (2015-2020)
- **Special Representative for Iraq / Head of UNAMI** (2013-2015)

### Bulgarian Government
- **Minister of Foreign Affairs** (2010-2013)

## Relevance
Mladenov's appointment as Director-General bridges the Board of Peace to established UN peace process expertise. His tenure as UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East gives the body operational credibility on its original Gaza mandate, while his diplomatic background provides institutional knowledge of the multilateral system the Board may challenge.
