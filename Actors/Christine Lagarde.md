# Christine Lagarde

## Overview
President of the European Central Bank (ECB) since 2019. Former Managing Director of the IMF (2011-2019). Former French Finance Minister (2007-2011). One of the most prominent figures in global economic governance.

## Davos 2026 Incident

At the World Economic Forum (January 22, 2026), Lagarde walked out of Commerce Secretary [[Howard Lutnick]]'s speech after he declared "Europe was dead."

The walkout was notable because Lagarde is known for being "very gracious, very professional" - the departure represented an uncharacteristic break in diplomatic protocol that signaled the depth of European frustration with the Trump administration's approach.

## Significance
The walkout symbolizes the rupture in US-European relations under Trump 2.0. When even highly diplomatic figures like Lagarde publicly break with American officials, it indicates the relationship has moved beyond normal policy disagreements.

## Background
- French lawyer and politician
- First woman to head the IMF
- First woman to head the ECB
- Consistently ranked among world's most powerful women
- Known for steady hand during Eurozone debt crisis and COVID response
