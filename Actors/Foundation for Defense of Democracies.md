# Foundation for Defense of Democracies

The Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) is a Washington, D.C.-based nonpartisan 501(c)(3) research institute focusing on national security and foreign policy. Founded in 2001, it has become one of the most influential hawkish think tanks in US foreign policy, particularly on [[Iran Sanctions|Iran sanctions]] policy.

## History

FDD was founded in 2001, originally under the name "Emet" (Hebrew for "truth"). Its initial IRS filings stated its mission was "to provide education to enhance Israel's image in North America and the public's understanding of issues affecting Israeli-Arab relations." After the September 11 attacks, its mission broadened to "conduct research and provide education on international terrorism and related issues."

In 2019, FDD executives created FDD Action, a 501(c)(4) organization that officially registered as a lobbying entity under the Lobbying Disclosure Act.

## Leadership

| Role | Person | Background |
|------|--------|------------|
| Founder & President | Clifford D. May | Journalist, former RNC communications director |
| CEO | Mark Dubowitz | Former Trump adviser on Iran; sanctioned by Iran in 2019 |

## Key Programs

### Iran Program
FDD's flagship area. Led by CEO Mark Dubowitz. The organization has been described by *The Atlantic* as having made "an institutional specialty of recommending hard-line Iran policies and offering detailed proposals for how to implement them." Key contributions:
- Founded the Iran Energy Project (2008), credited by *The Wall Street Journal* with bringing gasoline sanctions to political attention
- Led opposition to the [[JCPOA]] during the Obama administration
- Advised the first Trump administration on Iran policy
- Iran sanctioned FDD and Dubowitz in 2019 in response

### China Program
Chaired by [[Matt Pottinger]] (former Deputy National Security Advisor, 2019-2021). Focuses on CCP economic, technological, and security activities. In June 2023, an FDD delegation visited Taiwan and met with President Tsai Ing-wen to discuss asymmetric warfare strategies.

### Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation (CCTI)
Research on cybersecurity threats to the US government, private sector, and allies. Houses CSC 2.0, the successor to the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.

### Russia Program
Chaired by Clifford D. May. Covers Russian foreign and security policy, including Moscow's relationships with [[China]] and [[Iran]].

### Long War Journal
FDD's news and analysis site covering military operations and counterterrorism.

## Policy Influence

FDD occupies a hawkish position in the US foreign policy ecosystem, advocating maximum pressure through sanctions, cyber operations, and confrontational postures toward adversaries — particularly Iran, Russia, and China. It has significant influence in Republican policy circles and has been a key pipeline for Iran policy proposals across administrations.

**Characterizations:**
- Described as part of the [[US-Israel Relations|Israel lobby]] by John Mearsheimer (2007) and others
- Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs confirmed FDD works "in conjunction with" the Israeli government
- Media Bias/Fact Check rates it as right-center with mixed factual reporting

## Funding

Revenue of $23.9 million (2023). Early donors (2001-2004, revealed via Form 990 documents published by ThinkProgress in 2011) included the Abramson Family Foundation, Steinhardt Partners ($250,000 in 2004), and the Sarah Scaife Foundation. FDD does not publicly disclose current donors.
