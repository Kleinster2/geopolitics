## Origins

### Historical Roots (1950s-1980s)

- 1950s: Rural elites hired private militias against various threats
- 1982: Foundation laid at Puerto Boyacá meetings between cattle ranchers, businessmen, politicians, and military
- Private armies emerged with ties to local, regional, and national elites

### Castaño Brothers

Fidel, Carlos, and Vicente Castaño formed *Las Tangas* (Los Tangeros) after FARC killed their father. Evolved into death squads through 1980s.

### Formal Founding (1997)

AUC officially formed April 1997 as umbrella organization uniting regional paramilitary groups under Castaño leadership.

## Funding Sources

- **Drug trafficking**: 70% of operational funding (Carlos Castaño admission)
- **Landowner contributions**: Voluntary or coerced
- **Corporate backing**: Cattle ranchers, mining/petroleum companies
- **Chiquita**: International fruit company later fined $25 million by US for AUC payments

## Operations and Methods

### Scale of Violence

- 1997-1999: Killed 19,000+ people in first two years
- Targeted communities suspected of guerrilla sympathies
- Known for massacres and severe civilian victimization

### Stated Purpose

Counter-insurgency against FARC and ELN guerrillas. Framed as filling security vacuum left by state.

## Demobilization

### Peace Process (2002-2006)

- 2002: Negotiations began amid internal AUC tensions
- July 2003: Demobilization agreement signed
- Early 2006: Bulk of blocs demobilized
- 2008: Top leadership extradited to US

### Incomplete Transition

Many ex-paramilitaries returned to criminality. Vicente Castaño and mid-level commanders created successor organizations.

## Successor Groups

- **Gulf Clan** (*Clan del Golfo* / Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces): Largest successor, controls Urabá region
- **BACRIM** (*Bandas Criminales Emergentes*): Neo-paramilitary alliance

## Political Legacy

AUC infiltration of Colombian politics exposed in *parapolítica* scandal—dozens of congressmen convicted of paramilitary ties. Ongoing political relevance:

- [[Abelardo de la Espriella]]: 2026 presidential candidate, former AUC advisor
- [[Iván Cepeda]]: Career defined by anti-paramilitary activism; father killed by paramilitaries
