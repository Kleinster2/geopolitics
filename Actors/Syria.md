# Syria

## Overview
Eastern Mediterranean country that became the site of devastating civil war (2011-) and proxy conflict involving regional and global powers. The Assad regime's fall (late 2024) after 13 years of war reshaped regional dynamics. Key theater for Iran-Israel confrontation, Russian power projection, and Turkish security concerns.

## Key Facts
- **Capital**: Damascus
- **Population**: ~23 million pre-war; ~7 million refugees, millions internally displaced
- **Ethnic composition**: Arab majority, Kurdish minority (~10%), others
- **Religion**: Sunni majority (~70%), Alawite (~12%), Christian, Druze

## The Civil War (2011-2024)

### Origins (2011)
- Arab Spring protests against Assad
- Regime crackdown → armed rebellion
- Sectarian dimensions (Alawite regime vs. Sunni majority)
- Rapid fragmentation

### Key Phases
1. **2011-2013**: Uprising, regime survival in doubt
2. **2013-2015**: Jihadist rise (ISIS, Al-Nusra), fragmentation
3. **2015-2020**: Russian intervention saves Assad, territorial reconquest
4. **2020-2024**: Frozen conflict, regime controlling most territory
5. **Late 2024**: Regime collapse, Assad flees

### Casualties and Displacement
- **Deaths**: 500,000+ (estimates vary)
- **Refugees**: ~7 million (Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Europe)
- **Internally displaced**: ~7 million
- **Infrastructure**: Devastated

## External Actors

### Russia
- Military intervention (September 2015)
- Airpower saved Assad regime
- Naval base at Tartus, airbase at Hmeimim
- Testing ground for weapons, tactics
- Status uncertain post-Assad fall

### Iran
- Assad's key backer alongside Russia
- IRGC, Hezbollah, Shia militias deployed
- Land corridor to Lebanon/Hezbollah
- Major investment, major loss with Assad fall
- [[Axis of Resistance]] centerpiece

### Turkey
- Backed opposition initially
- Shifted to anti-Kurdish focus
- Multiple military operations against YPG/SDF
- Controls northwest zone (Idlib, border areas)
- Hosts ~4 million Syrian refugees

### United States
- Anti-ISIS campaign (from 2014)
- Partnered with Kurdish SDF
- ~900 troops remain (northeast)
- Limited goals: counter-ISIS, contain Iran

### Israel
- Hundreds of strikes on Iranian targets in Syria
- Preventing weapons transfers to Hezbollah
- Buffer zone concerns (Golan)
- No regime change goal, but benefited from Assad fall

## Post-Assad Transition (2024-)

### Regime Collapse
- Rapid opposition advance (late 2024)
- Assad fled to Russia
- HTS (Hayat Tahrir al-Sham) led takeover
- Uncertain transition

### Key Questions
- HTS governance: Islamist rule?
- Kurdish autonomy: Turkish intervention risk
- Russian/Iranian bases: Status unclear
- Refugee returns: Feasible?
- Reconstruction: Who pays?

## Geopolitical Significance

### For Iran
- Massive strategic loss
- Land corridor to Hezbollah severed
- Axis of Resistance weakened
- Years of investment lost

### For Russia
- Base access uncertain
- Prestige blow after backing Assad
- Overstretched (Ukraine priority)

### For Israel
- Iranian threat in Syria reduced
- But uncertainty about new rulers

### For Turkey
- Kurdish question paramount
- Refugee returns possible
- Influence opportunity
