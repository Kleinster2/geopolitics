# Alexander Lukashenko

## Overview
President of Belarus (1994-present). Often described as "Europe's last dictator." Heavily dependent on Russia since 2020 protest crackdown. Allowed Belarus to be used as staging ground for Ukraine invasion. [[Board of Peace]] signatory.

## Positions

### Domestic
- Authoritarian rule since 1994
- Crushed 2020 mass protests with Russian backing
- Political prisoners estimated in thousands
- Western sanctions over human rights abuses

### Foreign Policy (On-the-Record)
- Near-total dependence on Russia post-2020
- Allowed Russian forces to stage Ukraine invasion from Belarusian territory (2022)
- Hosted Russian tactical nuclear weapons (2023)
- Occasional attempts at independence from Moscow (rhetorical)

### Board of Peace
Signed as member. His inclusion (alongside Putin's invitation) cited by Western critics as undermining the body's credibility, given Belarus's role in Ukraine invasion and domestic repression.
