# Ayandeh Bank

## Overview
Iranian private bank whose collapse in late 2025 helped trigger the [[Iran Protests 2025-2026]]. Described by Iran's Central Bank as "a Ponzi scheme," Ayandeh's failure exposed the systemic rot in Iran's financial system and wiped out depositors' savings.

## Key Facts
- **Type**: Private bank
- **Status**: Collapsed (late 2025)
- **Losses**: ~$5 billion
- **Cause**: Self-lending scheme
- **Management**: Regime-affiliated individuals

## The Collapse

### What Happened
Ayandeh Bank failed after accumulating nearly $5 billion in losses from bad loans. Investigation revealed massive self-lending—bank insiders made loans to companies they controlled, which never repaid.

### Central Bank Assessment
A Central Bank of Iran official bluntly described Ayandeh as "a Ponzi scheme." The bank was taking deposits and lending them to connected insiders who extracted the money, leaving nothing to repay depositors.

### How It Worked
1. Regime-connected individuals controlled the bank
2. Bank made loans to companies owned by these insiders
3. Companies took the money, didn't repay
4. Losses hidden through accounting tricks
5. Eventually unsustainable—depositors couldn't withdraw
6. Collapse exposed the fraud

## Impact

### On Depositors
- Savings wiped out
- Middle class particularly affected
- Contributed to rage fueling protests

### On Banking System
- Exposed systemic fragility
- Five other banks reportedly in similar condition
- Loss of confidence in entire sector
- Deposit flight accelerated

### On Protests
The Ayandeh collapse was a direct trigger for the December 2025 protests:
- Showed regime corruption in stark terms
- United economic grievances with political anger
- Bazaaris (merchants) affected → joined protests
- Symbol of regime's broken promises

## Broader Pattern
Ayandeh is not unique—it represents systemic problems in [[Iranian Banking System]]:
- Self-dealing by regime insiders
- No real supervision
- [[IRGC]] involvement in finance
- Political connections over creditworthiness
- Sanctions pressure compounding problems
