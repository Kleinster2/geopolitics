# Howard Lutnick

## Overview
US Commerce Secretary in the Trump 2.0 administration. CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services firm. Co-chair of Trump's transition team before joining the cabinet.

## Davos 2026

### "Europe Was Dead" Speech
At the World Economic Forum (January 22, 2026), Lutnick gave a speech declaring that "Europe was dead."

The speech prompted Christine Lagarde (ECB President) to stand up and walk out - a dramatic break in diplomatic protocol from a normally measured figure.

The incident exemplifies the confrontational posture of Trump administration officials toward European allies at Davos, going beyond policy disagreements to open insults.

## Significance
Along with [[Scott Bessent]], represents the "amplifier" wing of Trump 2.0 - officials who intensify rather than moderate Trump's approach to allies. Contrasts with Trump 1.0 officials like Mattis, McMaster, and Tillerson who often served as "guardrails."
