- Including Quds Force leadership

- Loss of institutional knowledge and networks
- Israeli strikes exposed air defense failures
- Organization at weakest point since founding

**Strategic Implications:**
- Proxy networks operating without experienced handlers
- Reduced capacity for external operations
- Internal security mission strained
- [[Artesh]] (regular army) may not support IRGC if it falters
