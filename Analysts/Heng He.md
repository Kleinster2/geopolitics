## Overview
Veteran China analyst and columnist at The Epoch Times specializing in CCP elite politics and military affairs. Known for analysis of internal power dynamics within Chinese leadership.

## Key Facts
- **Position**: Columnist, The Epoch Times
- **Focus areas**: CCP leadership, military purges, elite politics
- **Perspective**: Critical of CCP; views party as fundamentally unreformable

## Analysis: CMC Purges (January 2026)

From Epoch Times interview ("American Thought Leaders"), January 31, 2026:

### On January 24, 2026 Announcement
China's Ministry of National Defense announced Zhang Youxia and Liu Zhenli (top two military generals) under investigation for "serious disciplinary and legal violations."

### Key Claims (Unverified)
He characterizes the purges as a "coup" by Xi Jinping to reassert control:

**On scale:**
- Claims 5 of 7 original CMC members have been purged or removed
- Only Xi Jinping and Miao Hua (promoted October 2025) remain
- Argues this exceeds purges during Cultural Revolution in severity

**On procedure violations:**
- Claims announcement used vague "CCP central" rather than specifying which body authorized
- Argues no proper Central Committee or CMC meeting was held
- "What Xi Jinping did was against every single rule, even the hidden rules"

**On military implications:**
- "The chain of command in the military is totally broken"
- Purged generals (Zhang, Liu) were only CMC members with battlefield experience
- Claims professional military leadership replaced by "political commissar" types

**On Taiwan:**
- Argues purged generals opposed Taiwan invasion as premature
- Claims their removal reflects Xi's ambition conflicting with professional military opinion
- Views military as now weaker for external conflict but regime internally unstable

### On WSJ Nuclear Secrets Story
Dismisses Wall Street Journal report (claiming Zhang leaked nuclear secrets to US) as deliberate disinformation:
- "Somebody on [Xi's] side tried to make the coup look legal"
- Argues Zhang had no motive (already at top, couldn't be bribed)
- Notes official PLAN Daily accusations focused on political crimes, not espionage
- Ministry of National Defense denied nuclear secret accusations at press conference

## Analytical Framework
- Views CCP as fundamentally unchanged since 1949 - "overtaking the whole world" remains core ideology
- Draws parallels to Soviet collapse: "System collapsed, not the military"
- Sees reform period (Deng era) as temporary deviation from CCP nature
- Compares current situation to Cultural Revolution turning points
- Argues Xi is destroying the system even while consolidating personal power

## Caveats
- The Epoch Times was founded by [[Falun Gong]] practitioners; the movement has been persecuted by CCP since 1999, giving the outlet a direct adversarial relationship with the party
- Many claims about internal dynamics are unverifiable
- "Coup" characterization is his interpretation, not established fact
- Claims about Xi's motivations and generals' beliefs are not independently confirmable

## Historical Parallels He Cites
| Event | Year | Parallel |
|-------|------|----------|
| Liu Shaoqi taking power from Mao | 1962 | Power transfer after failure |
| Lin Biao purge and death | 1971 | Turning point for Mao's legacy |
| Gang of Four arrest | 1976 | End of Cultural Revolution |
| Zhao Ziyang purge | 1989 | Purge of top leader during crisis |
