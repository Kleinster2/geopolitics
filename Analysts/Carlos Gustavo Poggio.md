# Carlos Gustavo Poggio

## Overview
Brazilian professor of International Relations, specializing in US politics. Regular commentator on CNN Brasil's international affairs programming.

## Key Analysis

### European Unity as Watershed (January 2026)
On the joint British-French troop deployment to Greenland:
- Unprecedented unified European response to US
- Contrasts with Iraq 2003 when Europe was divided
- "Divisor de águas" (watershed) in US-Europe relations

### Trump's Real Estate Mindset
- Understands Trump as real estate developer wanting to acquire territory
- Pressure tactics to force negotiation
- Exploiting European vulnerabilities:
  - Military pressure from Russia
  - Economic weakness (Germany in recession 2 years)

### Tariff Credibility Collapse
- If you sum all Trump's tariff threats (25% Iran dealings, 10%→25% Greenland, 15% existing), "doesn't make sense"
- Markets stopped reacting: "the next day the stock market doesn't move because they don't take it seriously"
- Iran tariff never materialized
- Greenland tariff still just social media post, no executive order
- Signs agreements one day, threatens tariffs the next
- EU deals are just "letters of intent," not real treaties

### Structural Change in US Politics
On why this transcends Trump personally:
- "It's not just Donald Trump. The problem is that Donald Trump created a movement that can return to power at any moment."
- JD Vance "perhaps even more anti-European than Trump himself"
- Ideas that were marginal in US politics years ago now at center of one major party
- "Europeans won't forget this"

### World Reconfiguration
- "We are watching a world beginning to reconfigure for a United States that is definitively playing a very different role than it has since the end of World War II"
