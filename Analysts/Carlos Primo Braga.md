## Key Analysis

### Historical US Interest in Greenland (150+ Years)
On the pattern of US attempts to acquire Greenland:
- **1867**: After Alaska purchase from Russia, Secretary of State William Seward proposed acquisition and commissioned study
- **1940**: When Nazis invaded Denmark, US sent Coast Guard personnel as "volunteers"
- **Cold War**: US dramatically increased bases with Danish/Greenlandic authorization for strategic protection
- **Post-1991**: Presence diminished significantly with Soviet collapse
- **2019**: Trump first raised acquisition in first term
- **2025**: Renewed threats in second term

Arguments always the same: strategic Arctic location, mineral access, geopolitical conflicts.

### McKinley as Trump's Model
Trump inspired by President McKinley, "the tariff man" of the 19th century - Trump's "great idol." Same playbook: tariffs as leverage, territorial expansion.

### Turnberry Agreement (July 27, 2025)
On the EU-US trade deal:
- Negotiated after Liberation Day (April 2, 2025)
- **Not consistent with WTO rules**
- Terms: US imposes 15% on EU imports; EU imposes 0% on US imports
- Still being analyzed by European Parliament
- EU announced freezing the agreement given new Greenland tariff threats

### EU Retaliation List
On the €93 billion retaliation:
- Products: Boeing aircraft, soybeans, whiskey, motorcycles, etc.
- Two selection criteria:
  1. Easy to source from non-US origins
  2. Hurts segments of American society that support Trump

### Anti-Coercion Instrument
- Created 2023, **never used**
- If activated, EU could impose measures beyond tariffs: intellectual property restrictions, market access limits for US companies (e.g., communications sector)
- "Would lead to very significant impact"

### WTO Assessment
On multilateral trade system's current state:
- Doha Round "is in limbo - actually dead, but nobody likes to talk about it"
- WTO different from World Bank/IMF: one country one vote, consensus-based
- US has ~15-16% World Bank shares, veto power for constitutional changes (need 85%)
- Multilateral trade system initiated under US leadership post-WWII, culminated in WTO creation (1995)
- System depends fundamentally on support from largest economies (US, EU, China)
- Dispute settlement system paralyzed due to US actions
- "Very difficult to see WTO having significant impact in short term"

### Silver Lining
Current tensions will likely help ratification of EU-Mercosur agreement. Also benefits Embraer given Boeing limitations in European market.
