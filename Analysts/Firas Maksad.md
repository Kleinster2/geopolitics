## Analysis: Iran Protests (January 2026)

From PBS "Compass Points" panel discussion:

### On Iranian Weakness
- Regime at "weakest point since the revolution in 1979"
- Not just domestic factors - external context critical:
  - Two-year degradation of proxy network (Hamas, Hezbollah)
  - Assad regime gone - "main conduit to project power in the region"
  - 12-day war dealt heavy blow to credibility
- Regime exposed as "paper tiger"
- "House with no roof" - air defenses destroyed

### On Regional Response
- GCC countries concerned about blowback
- They host US military facilities, have energy infrastructure at risk
- Straits of Hormuz vulnerability
- Need sufficient US military hardware and security assurances
- Two weeks ago, Arab allies cautioned Trump against immediate strikes
- Advised to "set the theater" first

### On Trump Administration Intent
- Argues administration was **never** looking for regime change
- "Very clear" from Witkoff texting Iranian FM on 4-item deal
- Using street pressure to push regime toward negotiations
- Describes it as "hard-nosed realist administration"
- References Trump in Riyadh: "The neocons are out. We're not in the business of telling the region who should govern it anymore."
- Believes they may still get a deal "on the back end of military strikes"

### Key Insight
Distinguishes between what the Iran situation *is* vs *is not*:
- IS: Search for a deal on 4 items
- IS NOT: Effort to empower protesters or pursue regime change

## Analytical Framework
- Emphasizes external/regional context over purely domestic factors
- Focuses on regime credibility and deterrence posture
- Attentive to Arab ally concerns and regional dynamics
- Reads Trump administration as transactional/deal-seeking
