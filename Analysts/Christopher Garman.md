## Key Analysis: Top Risks 2026 (January 2026)

### What They're NOT Worried About
Notably absent from 2026 risk list:
- **US-China crisis** - Seeing "normalization" between superpowers
- **Trade uncertainty** - Main tariff measures already implemented
- **Middle East** - Iran weakened, lower oil spike risk

### Trump's Paradox
Trump enters 2026:
- **Politically weakened**: Approval dropped to 41-42% (cost of living)
- **But feels empowered**: Foreign policy wins (Iran, Venezuela)
- **Key insight**: "When weakened, he doubles down" - doesn't retreat
- Will likely lose Congress in November midterms

### "Revolutionary Government"
On the self-description of Trump's project:
- "This is not a term we at Eurasia invented"
- Trump's circle, including Steve Bannon, describe it as revolution
- Goal: "eliminate the cooption of the state by progressive forces"
- They believe democracy was weakened by progressive capture
- Historical analogy: FDR's expansion of executive power

### Institutional Stress
Manifestations of "state capitalism with American characteristics":
- Jerome Powell investigation (attack on Fed - won't prevail but creates uncertainty)
- Credit card interest rate limits
- Real estate market intervention
- **Result**: Dollar weakening expected, institutional confidence eroding

### Donroe Doctrine Tail Risks
On areas to watch:
- **Mexico**: Possible action against cartels without Sheinbaum approval (small but real risk)
- **Cuba**: "What we're most watching" in Latin America
- **Colombia**: On the radar

### Brazil Assessment
"Brazil is well positioned in this new world of geopolitical conflict":
- Has valuable assets: critical minerals, rare earths
- China access
- White House trying to normalize relations
- Europe wanted Mercosul deal for food/energy security
- "As a middle power in the Global South, not badly positioned"

### China Strategy Shift
On US-China dynamics:
- White House "played too hard"
- Realized China has bargaining power (rare earths, critical minerals)
- "They pulled back"
- Strategy now less aggressive
- Tariff policy entering equilibrium period

### Electoral Dynamics
- Cost of living is Trump's "electoral Achilles heel"
- Same dynamic globally: Lula's approval drop in H1 2025 was food/electricity prices
- Republican senators showing concern about November midterms
- Some friction emerging within Trump's congressional base
