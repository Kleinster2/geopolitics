## Analysis: Iran Protests (January 2026)

From PBS "Compass Points" panel discussion:

### On Martyrdom Dynamic
- Wrote about "a new generation of martyrs being created"
- Explains Shiite Islam concept: "better to die fighting for justice than to live with injustice" (since 7th century)
- Bodies carried to "Paradise of Zahra" cemetery with crowds shouting "Death to Khamenei"
- Security forces at cemetery trying to break them up

### On Regime Sustainability
- Argues regime is "no longer sustainable"
- Sees continuity from 2009 Green Movement through 2017-18-19 economic protests through 2022 "Woman Life Freedom"
- "You see this building in a way that the regime is no longer sustainable"

### On Security Force Dynamics
- Security forces "not monolithic"
- Notes 2009: people on top of Revolutionary Guard barracks shouting "Death to the dictator"
- All young men must serve in security forces - creates diversity of opinion
- "Where there are 5 Iranians, there are 6 opinions"

### On Protest Weaknesses
- Key problem: "protesters don't have an organization"
- "Lots of young Nelson Mandelas in Iran, but there's no African National Congress"
- No infrastructure, no leadership, no idea about the alternative

### On US Options
- "US is perfectly capable of destruction" - cites Iraq, Afghanistan
- "The problem is, what is the construct afterwards?"
- "With what end?" - no plan for what comes next
- Warns Revolutionary Guards could try to take power in chaos scenario
- "A lot of questions about this very huge step of a US strike"

### On Witkoff's 4 Demands
- Calls them "maximalist"
- Notes Iran has right under NPT to nuclear energy including enrichment to certain level
- Questions "is there the ability to compromise?"
- "Interest on both sides" in getting to table, but ability to compromise "unclear"

## Analytical Framework
- Long historical perspective on Iranian politics
- Skeptical of military intervention without clear day-after plan
- Emphasizes organizational weakness of opposition
- Attentive to religious/cultural dimensions (martyrdom)
- Sees cumulative effect of protest waves since 2009
