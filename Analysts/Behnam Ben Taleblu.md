## Analysis: Iran Protests (January 2026)

From PBS "Compass Points" panel discussion:

### On Scale and Historical Significance
- Calls it an "inflection point for the Islamic Republic"
- "Historic" and "unprecedented" - not just for 47-year Islamic Republic history
- Unprecedented in "past century and a half, if not two centuries, of the battle between the street and the state for power inside Iran"
- "Never has there been a crackdown like this before in such a rapid period of time in contemporary Iranian history"
- Notes Iranian population hasn't experienced insurgency, civil war, or sustained foreign war

### On Iranian Public Sentiment
- Reports hearing one word repeatedly from Iran: "Mizaneh?" (Persian for "Will he strike?")
- "All eyes... trained on Donald Trump"
- "It takes a lot to get Iranians, who are a highly nationalistic population, to be willing to call for this level of foreign intervention"
- Reports tweets from Iran: "If I die from an American missile, Ali Khamenei is my murderer"

### On Regime Survival Calculus
- "Regime will remain in power so long as the West remains indifferent and so long as the government... chooses to shoot its way through the crisis"
- "Unarmed protests against a state that is armed to the teeth"
- Points to Syrian and Iraqi civil wars as evidence of regime's willingness to use force

### On Nuclear Dimension
- "Rights come with responsibilities" - Iran in flagrant violations of safeguards since 2003-2006
- Argues no current nuclear crisis because of "Operation Midnight Hammer" (June 2025 US strikes)
- No declared uranium enrichment in Iran currently
- "No nuclear off-ramp for a humanitarian catastrophe"
- Trump drew "8 or 9" red lines in January alone on holding regime responsible

### On US Military Action
- Most favorable of panelists toward intervention
- "With 47 years of the Islamic Republic, there is no way out but through"
- Distinguishes "foreign-imposed regime change" from "foreign-supported regime change"
- Argues paving pathway for "most pro-American, most pro-Israeli population in the region" is the realist choice
- "For a regime like this that has a bounty on the president's head... no other alternative than using military force"
- But military force must be "nested" in "larger strategy that paves the pathway for either this or future rounds of protests"
- If Trump had intervened earlier in January, could have been "low and asymmetric" rather than "massive military operation"

### Machiavelli Analogy
- References Machiavelli on public displays of violence being "designed to satisfy and stupefy"
- Cites Soleimani strike, Fordow strike, Maduro capture as examples
- Notes Iranians "keen to meet him at every juncture" - January 2020 ballistic missile barrage was "biggest... that US forces faced in recorded history"

## Analytical Framework
- Hawkish on Iran - sees military pressure as necessary
- Emphasizes Iranian regime's willingness to use force
- Distinguishes nuclear nonproliferation issues from humanitarian crisis
- Focuses on regime's fundamental hostility (bounty on president)
- Argues for nesting military action in broader political strategy
