## Notable Analysis

### New START Expiration (February 2026)
On information asymmetry and arms races:
- Loss of inspection regime creates dangerous information asymmetry
- When you don't know what the other side is doing, incentive is to build more
- Treaty had flaws (inspections hadn't happened since pandemic) but better than nothing

On international order:
- Arms control collapse mirrors broader pattern
- Already visible in trade, multilateral organizations
- Now reaching nuclear domain
- Represents rupture in international order stability

On the Cold War bargain:
- When Bush and Gorbachev signed START I, limiting warheads was in both nations' interest
- "Fewer nuclear weapons = more stability, more trust, more order"
- That consensus no longer exists
