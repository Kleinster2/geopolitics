## Key Positions
- The Nile is the foundational driver of Egypt-Ethiopia rivalry: "The Nile is at the heart of everything, when you go back to the beginning"
- Egypt has sponsored Eritrean separatists since the 1950s specifically to prevent Ethiopian control of Nile headwaters
- This historical depth means current tensions are not new but an intensification of century-old dynamics
