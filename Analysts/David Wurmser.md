## Analysis: US-Iran Trajectory (February 1, 2026)

From NTD interview, February 1, 2026:

### On Arms Sales Strategy
Wurmser distinguishes between the Israel and Saudi packages:

**Saudi Arabia ($9B):**
- Long-term delivery timeframe
- Strategic purpose: "anchor Saudi Arabia to the western structure"
- Concern about Saudi "drifting off to China"
- Arms sales as traditional anchoring mechanism

**Israel ($6.67B):**
- Short-term/immediate delivery
- Apache helicopters: "Israelis would be getting 30 of those fairly quickly"
- Reflects view of "Israel's power as a major element of American deterrence in the region"
- Allows US to "reduce our power footprint to some extent"

### On Negotiations Gap
Key framing: "Iranians are trying to negotiate for a negotiation. President Trump is essentially negotiating an ultimatum."

**The nuclear terms gap:**
- FM Araghchi: "We don't want nuclear weapons" (but keep program)
- Trump: "No nuclear program" (not just no weapons)
- Wurmser: "There's no common ground there"
- Trump "knows that a nuclear program in Iran will be abused as a military program"

**Other demands:**
- Dismantle proxy network
- Eliminate missiles (threaten US troops, Israel, now Europe)

### On War Trajectory
- "I don't think it's going to avert a war"
- "The president is pretty far out on a limb now"
- "He's set out terms that Iran upfront cannot accept"
- "There would be a huge price to pay if he backs off"

**Key question** (per Wurmser): Not *whether* US strikes, but "once we start... will it go all the way to bring down the regime?"

### On Post-Strike Scenarios

**"Rump Islamic Republic" scenario:**
- Some regime elements might offer deal mid-conflict
- "We're willing to give up on those things... just let us survive as a truncated or rump Islamic republic"

**Why that's difficult:**
- Trump: "To allow a regime that killed so many people... is a difficult thing for the president to stomach"
- Israel: "Even more difficult thing for the Israelis to stomach"
- Risk: Israelis "taking matters into their own hands and finishing the war for the United States"

**His trajectory assessment:**
- "The real complexity begins once the war starts"
- "The Iranian people and the Israelis will go all the way"
- Iranian people "will rise up as the war begins and they won't stop"
- Israelis "pretty determined to have this be the last round with Iran"

### On Iranian Missile Capability
Claims Iran "tried or maybe did test a 10,000 kilometer range missile" - meaning all of Europe now under Iranian missile threat.

**Caveat**: This claim needs independent verification.

## Analytical Framework
- Views Israel as US deterrence proxy in region
- Sees arms sales as alliance anchoring mechanism
- Distinguishes "negotiating for negotiation" vs "negotiating ultimatum"
- Focuses on post-conflict scenarios and escalation dynamics
- Expects Iranian popular uprising to coincide with military action
- Sees Israeli determination as independent variable that could drive escalation

## Caveats
- Center for Security Policy is a hawkish think tank
- Cheney advisor background reflects neoconservative perspective
- Predictions about Iranian uprising and Israeli behavior are speculative
- Has institutional/ideological reasons to favor hawkish interpretation
