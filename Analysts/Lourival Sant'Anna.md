## Notable Analysis

### New START Expiration (February 2026)
On the three-way nuclear math problem:
- US wants parity with Russia + China combined
- Russia says "China is your problem"
- China has no incentive to negotiate given asymmetry

On nuclear-armed leaders:
- **Xi Jinping**: "Adult in the room" - rational, predictable despite autocracy
- **Putin**: "Nihilism" - sinister, destabilizing
- **Trump**: "Levity" - doesn't engage with sophisticated US establishment

Paradox: China drives the arms race, but Xi is more predictable than Trump or Putin.
