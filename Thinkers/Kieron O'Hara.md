# Kieron O'Hara

## Overview
British computer scientist and philosopher at University of Southampton. Leading scholar of internet governance models, known for the "Four Internets" framework distinguishing American, European, Chinese, and other approaches to digital governance. Works at intersection of technology, philosophy, and politics.

## Key Contributions

### Four Internets Framework
With Wendy Hall, developed influential typology of internet governance models:

| Model | Philosophy | Examples |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Silicon Valley Open Internet** | Free market, innovation, minimal regulation | US (traditional) |
| **Brussels Bourgeois Internet** | Rights-based, regulated, privacy-focused | EU/GDPR |
| **Beijing Paternal Internet** | State control, surveillance, censorship | China |
| **DC Commercial Internet** | Security-focused, corporate-friendly | US (post-Snowden) |

Later expanded to include Russian and Indian models.

### Web Science
Founding figure in "Web Science" - interdisciplinary study of the Web as socio-technical system. Argues Web must be studied not just technically but as social phenomenon.

### Digital Conservatism
Unusual perspective: applies conservative political philosophy to internet governance:
- Skeptical of both libertarian and regulatory extremes
- Values institutional continuity, evolved norms
- Wary of "move fast and break things" ideology
- Argues for preserving social capital online

## Academic Position
- Professor of Web Science, University of Southampton
- Fellow of the Web Science Trust
- Works with Tim Berners-Lee's Web Foundation
- Advisory roles in UK digital policy

## Key Works
- *The Spy in the Coffee Machine* (2008, with Nigel Shadbolt)
- *Four Internets: Data, Geopolitics, and the Governance of Cyberspace* (2020, with Wendy Hall)
- *Conservatism and the Digital Self* (forthcoming themes)
- Numerous academic papers on web science and governance

## Contemporary Relevance

### Splinternet Analysis
Four Internets framework directly addresses [[Splinternet]]:
- Different governance models incompatible
- Technical interoperability doesn't ensure value alignment
- Fragmentation may be inevitable given political divergence

### EU Digital Sovereignty
His "Brussels Bourgeois Internet" concept captures EU approach:
- GDPR as rights-based regulation
- Contrast with both US market approach and Chinese state control
- European "third way" in digital governance

### Geopolitical Implications
Framework useful for analyzing:
- US-China tech decoupling
- EU regulatory autonomy
- Global South positioning
- Standards competition
