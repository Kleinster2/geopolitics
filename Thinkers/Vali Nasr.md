## Analysis: Iran Protests (January 2026)

From PBS "Compass Points" panel discussion:

### On Regime Vulnerability
- Regime is "very vulnerable" and has been "on its death march for some time"
- But argues this point was NOT when it would collapse
- People looking to outside intervention means they don't feel capable of bringing regime down themselves
- "Balance of force still lies with the regime"

### On Regime Structure
- Islamic Republic is "not one man" - differs from 1979 Shah scenario
- It's a system, a regime - perhaps 10% of population dedicated to it
- "Designed to survive, not be popular"
- "At war with the US for 40 years, at war with its own population increasingly"
- Multiple nodes of power = resilience
- That diversity is "one of the reasons it's resilient"

### On IRGC Cohesion
- No evidence of Revolutionary Guard fracturing
- No garrison went to the people
- No soldiers refusing to kill
- The shock of the killing itself shows regime resolve

### On US Options
- Questions what US is actually offering - "If it's in terms of surrender, then..."
- Witkoff's 4 demands could potentially be "finagled" with creative language
- Points to past consortium arrangements where Iran could claim enrichment without domestic enrichment
- "We're not talking about negotiations" - more like "Emperor Hirohito meeting General MacArthur"
- US hasn't laid out clear objectives - shifted from regime change to leadership change to "come to the table please"
- Administration hasn't laid out day-after plan
- "You can always start a war... but it may not pan out"
- Israeli 12-day war was militarily successful but "didn't get actually what it went for"

### On Risk of Escalation
- Danger is Iranian calculation "might be different" this time
- May decide they need to "draw blood" - not symbolic responses
- Cites 1985 Beirut barracks attack killing 500 Marines as example of Iran's capability for carnage

## Analytical Framework
- Skeptical of maximalist US demands producing results
- Emphasizes gap between military capability and political outcomes
- Warns against assuming military success = strategic success
- Focuses on regime survival instincts and structural resilience
