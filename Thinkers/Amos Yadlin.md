## Key Analysis (2025-2026)

### Preemptive Force Doctrine (December 2025)
In a Times of Israel blog post, Yadlin argued that October 7, 2023 shattered Israel's deterrence assumptions. Actors "immune to deterrence" and driven by ideological imperatives can launch surprise attacks even when strategically suicidal. He applies this lesson directly to Iran.

### Iran Preemptive Strike Warning (January 2026)
On Channel 12 (January 11-12, 2026), Yadlin warned that Iran might launch a preemptive attack on Israel:
- "Western logic" would suggest Tehran has no incentive to start a war with both the US and Israel
- But "jihadi logic, extremist religious logic, could be different"
- IDF should prepare "as though there is going to be a surprise"
- Hopes IDF has built an operational model assuming "the Iranians may do something that does not seem logical"
- Cited Iran's desire for revenge following the June 2025 war

The IDF itself echoed this concern within days, saying it remained on alert for "surprise scenarios" (per Times of Israel, January 12, 2026).

### Post-June 2025 War Assessment
Yadlin has argued that Israel restored deterrence against Iran through the June 2025 war -- but only temporarily. The structural drivers of conflict (nuclear ambitions, ideological enmity, regional competition) remain unresolved.

## Significance
Yadlin's analytical weight derives from unique operational experience: he personally executed the 1981 Osirak strike, oversaw intelligence during the 2007 Syria reactor strike, and has spent decades planning Israel's preemptive operations against nuclear threats. When he warns about an Iranian preemptive strike, he is applying firsthand knowledge of how the other side of this equation works.
