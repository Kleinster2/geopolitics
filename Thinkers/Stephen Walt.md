# Stephen Walt

## Overview
Leading American international relations scholar and neorealist theorist. Professor at Harvard Kennedy School. Known for "balance of threat" theory and critique of US foreign policy, particularly the Israel lobby's influence. In 2026, coined "predatory hegemony" to describe Trump's approach to allies.

## Key Facts
- **Position**: Robert and Renée Belfer Professor of International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School
- **Education**: PhD, UC Berkeley
- **School**: Neorealism / Defensive Realism
- **Orientation**: Realist, restraint advocate

## Major Works

### Books
- *The Origins of Alliances* (1987) - Balance of threat theory
- *Revolution and War* (1996)

- *The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy* (2007, with John Mearsheimer) - Controversial critique
- *The Hell of Good Intentions* (2018) - Critique of liberal hegemony

### Key Concepts

**Balance of Threat Theory**
- States balance against threats, not just power
- Threat = power + proximity + offensive capability + aggressive intent
- Explains alliance formation better than pure balance of power

**Offshore Balancing**
- US should avoid direct military presence in Eurasia
- Let regional powers balance each other
- Intervene only when necessary to prevent hegemony
- Less costly, more sustainable

## 2026: "Predatory Hegemony" Concept

### Definition
From GZERO World interview (January 2026):

> "All great powers are predators to some degree, but they usually confine their acts of predation to their adversaries... What Trump has done is he's applying that to our allies as well. In all bilateral relationships, his view is: what's mine is mine, what's yours is negotiable."

### Key Features
- Predation against **allies**, not just adversaries
- Extracting maximum concessions from everyone
- More effective against dependent allies (short term)
- Long-term loser as allies diversify

### Examples Cited
- South Korea: Tariff threats → forced investment concessions
- Greenland: No security need, about "marking territory"
- Venezuela: Not about drugs/democracy, about hemispheric control

### Allied Response
Countries that pushed back (Brazil, China) did better than accommodators.

## On Trump's Foreign Policy

### Speed vs. Direction
> "I'm surprised not by the direction things have gone, but by the sort of speed and scope by which things have changed."

### Use of Force
- Trump prefers "short, sharp, discrete uses of force, primarily air power"
- Picks on weak countries that can't retaliate
- Not averse to force, averse to forever wars

### Greenland Assessment
> "There's no economic or security reason why we have to [control Greenland]. The current treaty arrangements give the United States as much access as it might ever want. This is all about essentially marking territory."

### Venezuela Assessment
- Not about narcotics (Venezuela not major drug source)
- Not about democracy (old regime left in place)
- Not about security threat
- Really about putting Latin America on notice: "This is our hemisphere and we're going to run it"

### Long-term Damage
Most concerned about: Gutting of research and development, assault on universities
> "The next several presidents are going to deal with the consequences of the damage that's been done to our research and development capabilities."
