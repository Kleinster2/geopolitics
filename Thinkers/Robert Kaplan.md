## Analytical Framework

### The Revenge of Geography

Core argument: Geography, temporarily eclipsed by technology and ideology, is reasserting itself in international politics.

Key points:
- Physical environment constrains and channels political possibilities
- Mountains, rivers, coastlines create recurring strategic patterns
- Maps reveal what elites often miss
- Technology changes geography's meaning but doesn't eliminate it

### On China

Kaplan emphasizes China's **continental-maritime duality**:
- Vast land borders creating security anxieties
- Long coastline enabling Pacific ambitions
- South China Sea as "Asia's Mediterranean" - whoever dominates it controls regional trade
- China's geography both enables expansion and invites encirclement

This analysis parallels [[Hal Brands]]' "amphibious geography" argument (February 2026).

### On the Indian Ocean

*Monsoon* argues the Indian Ocean will be the strategic center of the 21st century:
- Energy flows (Persian Gulf → Asia)
- Trade routes
- Rising powers (China, India) competing for influence
- US naval dominance challenged

## Influence

- *Balkan Ghosts* allegedly reinforced Clinton administration's intervention hesitancy
- Advises military and intelligence communities
- Accessible style reaches beyond academia

### Criticism
- Accused of geographic determinism

- *Balkan Ghosts* criticized for fatalism about ethnic conflict
- Environmental determinism concerns
