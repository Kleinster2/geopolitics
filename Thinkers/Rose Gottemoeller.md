- First woman in this role

### Arms Control Philosophy
- Verification as foundation of trust
- Incremental progress over grand bargains
- Bilateral frameworks as building blocks
- Skeptical of informal arrangements

## Notable Analysis

### On Putin's Extension Proposal (2025)
Per FT/Ukraine RBC: Gottemoeller stated that "accepting Putin's proposal for a voluntary extension makes no sense."

Reasoning: Voluntary arrangements lack:
- Verification mechanisms
- Legal bindingness
- Enforcement provisions
- Predictability that treaties provide

### On Arms Control Future
Has argued for:
- Preserving what remains of verification architecture
- Finding pathways to include China
- Addressing new technologies in future frameworks
- Maintaining expert-to-expert channels

## Framework Contribution

### Verification-Centered Approach
Gottemoeller's work emphasizes that arms control value comes from:
1. **Transparency**: Knowing what other side has
2. **Predictability**: Knowing what they'll do
3. **Communication**: Channels for clarification
4. **Verification**: Confirming compliance

Without these, mere promises provide false confidence.
