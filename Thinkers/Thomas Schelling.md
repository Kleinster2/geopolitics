# Thomas Schelling

## Overview
American economist and Nobel laureate (2005) who revolutionized understanding of strategic interaction, bargaining, and conflict. Applied game theory to nuclear strategy, showing how adversaries communicate through actions and threats. *Arms and Influence* (1966) remains essential reading for understanding coercion, escalation, and signaling.

## Key Contributions

### The Strategy of Conflict (1960)
Foundational work on strategic interaction. Key concepts:

**Focal points (Schelling points)**: In coordination problems, people converge on solutions that seem "natural" or salient—even without communication. Explains how adversaries can tacitly coordinate on limits (e.g., the nuclear taboo, geographic boundaries in limited wars).

**Commitment**: How to make threats credible by visibly limiting your own options. Burning bridges, tying hands, creating audience costs.

**Bargaining as communication**: Conflict is a bargaining process where violence signals resolve and capability, not just military defeat.

### Arms and Influence (1966)
Extended bargaining framework to military strategy:

**Compellence vs. deterrence**: Deterrence prevents action; compellence forces action. Compellence is harder—requires continuous pressure until adversary complies.

**The threat that leaves something to chance**: In nuclear confrontation, the threat isn't certain retaliation but shared risk of uncontrolled escalation. Brinkmanship manipulates this shared risk.

**Violence as communication**: Military action in limited war is a language, signaling resolve and establishing limits, not just destroying enemy forces.

### The Nuclear Taboo
Analyzed why nuclear weapons haven't been used since 1945. Not just deterrence—a normative taboo developed, a focal point that both sides tacitly agreed not to cross. The taboo is valuable precisely because it's categorical, not calculated case-by-case.

## Influence

### Nuclear Strategy
- Shaped thinking on limited war, escalation control, arms control
- Influenced Kennedy administration's flexible response doctrine
- Arms control negotiations (tacit bargaining between adversaries)

### Beyond Security
- Economics: addiction, self-control, commitment devices
- Segregation dynamics (*Micromotives and Macrobehavior*)
- Climate change as coordination problem

### Nobel Prize (2005)
Awarded jointly with Robert Aumann "for having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis."

## Contemporary Relevance

### Ukraine
- Range restrictions as tacit bargaining—signaling limits while probing
- Escalation as communication, not just military action
- Nuclear threats as manipulating shared risk

### Deterrence Theory
- Credibility problems in extended deterrence
- How to commit credibly when costs are high
- Focal points in establishing red lines

## Key Works

- *Arms and Influence* (1966)
- *Micromotives and Macrobehavior* (1978)
- *Choice and Consequence* (1984)

## Key Quotes

On brinkmanship:
> "The threat that leaves something to chance... the final decision is not altogether under the threatener's control."

On limited war:
> "War is always a bargaining process... a competition in inflicting and tolerating damage."
