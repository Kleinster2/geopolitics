# Tim Wu

## Overview

Legal scholar who coined "net neutrality" and co-authored *Who Controls the Internet?* (2006), which argued that states would inevitably reassert sovereignty over cyberspace. Bridges academia and policy, having served in the Biden White House on technology and competition policy.

## Key Facts
- **Position**: Julius Silver Professor of Law, Columbia Law School
- **Government service**: Special Assistant to the President for Technology and Competition Policy (Biden White House, 2021-2023); Senior Advisor, FTC
- **Education**: JD (Harvard Law); BSc (McGill)
- **Orientation**: Progressive, pro-regulation, antitrust hawk

## Major Works

### "Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination" (2003)
Coined "net neutrality" - the principle that internet service providers should treat all traffic equally regardless of source, destination, or content. The concept that ISPs are common carriers, not editors.

Central to debates about:
- Whether infrastructure owners can discriminate among users
- Whether ISPs can charge for "fast lanes"
- Platform power vs. network openness

### *Who Controls the Internet?* (with Jack Goldsmith, 2006)
Core argument: The early vision of a borderless internet was an illusion. National governments would reassert sovereignty because:
- E-businesses need governmental support (contracts, property rights, dispute resolution)
- States have enforcement power over physical infrastructure
- Citizens demand local regulation (content, privacy, security)

This thesis has proven prescient - the subsequent two decades saw exactly this reassertion (see [[Digital Sovereignty]]).

### *The Master Switch* (2010)
Historical analysis of information industries (telephone, radio, film, television) showing a recurring cycle:
1. Open, decentralized innovation
2. Consolidation by dominant firm
3. Regulatory capture or state control
4. Eventually disrupted by new technology

Argued the internet would follow the same cycle. Evidence: platform consolidation (Google, Facebook, Amazon).

### *The Attention Merchants* (2016)
History of the advertising-attention economy from newspapers through social media. Shows how "free" services funded by advertising have always traded user attention for revenue - surveillance capitalism as the latest iteration.

### *The Curse of Bigness* (2018)
Antitrust manifesto arguing for revival of anti-monopoly tradition. Influenced Biden administration's aggressive antitrust stance (FTC under Lina Khan, DOJ cases against Google).

## Analytical Framework

### The Sovereignty Thesis (with Goldsmith)
Core prediction: The internet doesn't transcend politics; it becomes another domain where states assert power. Evidence:
- China's Great Firewall
- EU's GDPR
- US TikTok ban
- Russia's Sovereign Internet Law
- Data localization worldwide

### The Cycle (from *Master Switch*)
Information industries follow a pattern:
```
Open/Chaotic → Consolidation → Monopoly → Disruption
```
Applied to internet: Early web (open) → Platform era (consolidation) → Big Tech dominance (monopoly) → ? (AI disruption?)

### Net Neutrality as Governance Principle
Not just a technical rule but a governance philosophy: infrastructure should be neutral, power should not flow to those who control the pipes. This principle extends beyond ISPs to platforms, app stores, and cloud providers.

## Policy Influence

### Biden White House (2021-2023)
- Shaped executive order on competition (July 2021)
- Influenced antitrust enforcement posture
- Contributed to FTC's aggressive stance under Lina Khan
- Technology and competition policy coordination

### Net Neutrality Debate
- Term and framework dominated US telecom policy for 15+ years
- FCC Open Internet Order (2015) - adopted Wu's framework
- Repeal under Trump (2017)
- Ongoing regulatory oscillation

### Antitrust Revival
- *Curse of Bigness* influenced new generation of antitrust thinkers
- Contributed to intellectual foundation for Google/Meta/Amazon cases
- Part of "New Brandeis" movement in antitrust

## Concepts Developed/Popularized
- [[Internet Geopolitics]] (sovereignty thesis, net neutrality)
- [[Digital Sovereignty]] (predicted state reassertion)
- [[Surveillance Capitalism]] (attention merchants framework)

## Comparison to Other Thinkers

| Thinker | Relationship |
|---------|-------------|
| [[Lawrence Lessig]] | Teacher-student relationship; Wu extended Lessig's framework |
| Jack Goldsmith | Co-author; more conservative, national security focused |
| [[Milton Mueller]] | Mueller opposes sovereignty thesis; Wu sees it as descriptive, not normative |
| Lina Khan | Khan operationalized Wu's antitrust ideas at FTC |
| [[Shoshana Zuboff]] | Complementary - Wu on structure, Zuboff on business model |
