# Keir Lieber

## Overview
Georgetown University political scientist specializing in nuclear strategy, the offense-defense balance, and great power military competition. With frequent collaborator Daryl Press, has written influential (and controversial) work arguing US nuclear primacy over Russia and China is achievable and may be destabilizing.

## Key Contributions

### Nuclear Primacy Thesis
With Daryl Press, argued in "The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy" (*Foreign Affairs*, 2006) that:
- US approaching nuclear primacy over Russia
- Russian nuclear forces degraded; US could potentially destroy them in first strike
- Chinese forces even more vulnerable
- MAD (mutual assured destruction) may no longer hold

**Controversy:** Critics argued this overstated US capabilities and understated adversary responses. The article sparked major debate about stability.

### Counterforce Revolution
*The Myth of the Nuclear Revolution* (2020, with Press):
- Challenges view that nuclear weapons create automatic stability
- Argues counterforce capabilities (ability to destroy enemy nukes) matter
- First-strike advantages are real and affect crisis behavior
- States pursuing damage limitation, not just deterrence

### Implications for Policy
Their work suggests:
- Nuclear balance isn't static; technology changes stability
- Arms racing continues even in MAD world
- US allies may doubt extended deterrence if adversaries can threaten US homeland
- Arms control more important given counterforce incentives

## Academic Debates

### Stability-Instability Paradox
Lieber's work engages with whether nuclear weapons:
- Create stability (traditional view)
- Create instability at lower levels (paradox)
- Are less stabilizing than assumed (Lieber/Press position)

### First-Strike Stability
Central concern: If one side believes it can destroy other's nuclear forces, incentive to strike first in crisis increases. Even perception of this capability is destabilizing.

### Critics
- Austin Long, others: Underestimate adversary response, overestimate US capabilities
- Nuclear forces harder to destroy than analysis suggests
- Adversaries have options (mobile missiles, SSBNs) Lieber/Press downplay
- Could encourage dangerous policies
