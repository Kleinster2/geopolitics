## Overview
Georgetown University political scientist specializing in nuclear strategy, military operations, and inadvertent escalation. Her work on how conventional military operations could trigger nuclear use is central to contemporary debates about US-China conflict, particularly over Taiwan.

## Key Contributions

### Conventional Operations and Nuclear Escalation
Core research question: How might conventional war between nuclear powers escalate to nuclear use even if neither side wants it?

Key mechanisms:
- **Entanglement**: Conventional attacks on dual-use systems (early warning, command and control) could be mistaken for nuclear first strike preparation
- **Compression**: Fast-moving conventional war compresses decision time, increasing error risk
- **Use-it-or-lose-it**: Conventional attacks threatening nuclear forces create pressure to launch before destruction

### US-China Escalation Risks
Applied framework to Taiwan scenarios (*Foreign Affairs*, 2018):
- US conventional operations against China could inadvertently threaten Chinese nuclear deterrent
- Chinese SSBNs based near conventional submarine bases
- Attacks on Chinese command/control affects both conventional and nuclear
- Even "limited" US strikes could trigger Chinese nuclear response

This analysis influential in debates over Taiwan defense strategy.

### Military Effectiveness
Also studies what makes militaries effective:
- *The Dictator's Army* (2015): How authoritarian politics undermines military effectiveness
- Coup-proofing vs. combat effectiveness tradeoffs
- Applied to understanding adversary military performance

## Policy Relevance

### Taiwan Debates
Her escalation research directly shapes:
- How US should fight in Western Pacific
- What operations to avoid (attacking mainland early)
- Tradeoffs between military effectiveness and escalation risk
- Whether Taiwan can be defended without nuclear escalation

### Nuclear Posture
Informs debates on:
- Entanglement of conventional and nuclear systems
- First-strike stability
- Arms control priorities
- Crisis management
