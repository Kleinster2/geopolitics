# Bernard Brodie

## Overview
American military strategist who, within days of Hiroshima, recognized that nuclear weapons had fundamentally transformed warfare. Often called the "American Clausewitz" and founding father of nuclear deterrence theory. His insight that nuclear weapons' primary purpose was preventing war—not winning it—became foundational doctrine.

## The Nuclear Revolution

### Immediate Recognition (1945)
Within weeks of Hiroshima, Brodie grasped what took others years:

> "Thus far the chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win wars. From now on its chief purpose must be to avert them. It can have almost no other useful purpose."

This single insight—that nuclear weapons inverted the purpose of military force—became the foundation of deterrence theory.

### The Absolute Weapon (1946)
Edited volume published less than a year after Hiroshima, establishing core deterrence concepts:
- Nuclear weapons render traditional military victory meaningless
- Defense against nuclear attack effectively impossible
- Only strategy is preventing nuclear war through deterrence
- Survival requires threatening unacceptable retaliation

## Key Contributions

### Deterrence as Strategy
Brodie established that nuclear weapons were not just bigger bombs but a categorical change in warfare:
- War between nuclear powers could not be "won" in traditional sense
- Military strategy becomes preventing war, not fighting it
- Credible second-strike capability essential for stability
- Arms racing could be stabilized through mutual vulnerability

### Strategy vs. War-Fighting
Brodie represented the "deterrence-only" school against war-fighters like [[Herman Kahn]] who analyzed how nuclear war might be fought and "won." Brodie argued such thinking missed the point—nuclear weapons existed to prevent their use.

### Clausewitz and Nuclear Age
Brodie's *War and Politics* (1973) reexamined Clausewitz for nuclear era. War as continuation of politics by other means becomes problematic when war could end civilization. Politics must prevent nuclear war, not pursue objectives through it.

## Career

### Naval Strategy
Before nuclear weapons, Brodie was naval strategist. *A Layman's Guide to Naval Strategy* (1942) and *Sea Power in the Machine Age* (1941) established his reputation.

### RAND Corporation
Joined RAND in 1951, part of the remarkable collection of strategists (including [[Herman Kahn]], Albert Wohlstetter) who shaped nuclear doctrine. Later grew disillusioned with RAND's direction.

### Yale
Returned to academia, teaching at Yale. *War and Politics* (1973) reflected mature thinking on limits of strategic analysis.

## Influence

### Policy
- Shaped US nuclear doctrine toward deterrence
- Influenced thinking on mutual assured destruction (MAD)
- Arms control philosophy (stability through mutual vulnerability)

### Academic
- Established nuclear strategy as intellectual discipline
- Integrated political science, military history, strategic analysis
- Trained generation of strategists

## Criticism and Limitations
- Critics argued pure deterrence theory ignored what happens if deterrence fails
- Kahn and war-fighters argued refusing to plan for nuclear war made it more likely
- Later thinkers questioned whether MAD stability was as robust as assumed

## Key Works
- *A Layman's Guide to Naval Strategy* (1942)
- *The Absolute Weapon: Atomic Power and World Order* (1946, editor)
- *Strategy in the Missile Age* (1959)
- *Escalation and the Nuclear Option* (1966)
