# Shoshana Zuboff

## Overview

Social scientist whose *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* (2019) defined the dominant framework for understanding how tech companies extract and commodify behavioral data. Her work connects technology governance to broader questions of democracy and power.

## Key Facts
- **Position**: Charles Edward Wilson Professor Emerita, Harvard Business School
- **Education**: PhD, Harvard University
- **Orientation**: Democratic institutionalist, critic of unregulated tech power
- **Known for**: Coining "surveillance capitalism" (2014)

## Major Works

### *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* (PublicAffairs, 2019)
Core argument: A new economic logic in which tech companies claim human experience as free raw material, extracting behavioral data to predict and modify behavior for profit.

Key concepts:
- **Behavioral surplus**: Data beyond what's needed for service improvement, claimed as free resource
- **Prediction products**: Behavioral models sold to advertisers/clients
- **Instrumentarian power**: Power to shape behavior at scale without awareness
- **Epistemic counterrevolution**: Concentrating knowledge (and thus governance power) in corporate hands

### "Surveillance Capitalism or Democracy?" (*Organization Theory*, 2022)
Extended argument connecting surveillance capitalism to democratic erosion. Traces the system to Clinton-era decisions to cede internet governance to private firms.

### *In the Age of the Smart Machine* (1988)
Earlier work on how information technology transforms work. Identified the tension between "automating" (replacing workers) and "informating" (empowering workers with information). Foreshadowed later concern about who controls information flows.

## Analytical Framework

### The Three-Step Process
1. **Extraction** - Harvest behavioral data (clicks, location, social connections, biometrics)
2. **Prediction** - Build models of individual behavior
3. **Modification** - Sell predictions; nudge behavior toward profitable outcomes

### Historical Sequence
Zuboff identifies specific policy choices that enabled the system:
- Clinton-era internet deregulation (ceded governance to firms)
- Google's 2001 discovery (behavioral surplus could predict ad clicks)
- Post-9/11 surveillance state (normalized mass data collection)
- 2008 smartphone revolution (extended extraction to physical world)

### Geopolitical Implications
- Data extraction creates asymmetric knowledge: US firms know more about foreign populations than foreign governments do
- Creates dependency relationship between Global South and US tech (see [[Digital Colonialism]])
- China's alternative is state surveillance, not liberation from surveillance
- EU regulation (GDPR) limits extraction but doesn't eliminate the model

## Critiques

- **Overstates novelty**: Advertising has always tried to predict behavior
- **Understates user agency**: People knowingly use these services
- **Marxist critique**: Focuses on data extraction, ignores labor exploitation in supply chains
- **Technological determinism**: Implies inevitability rather than policy choice
- **Solutions vague**: Calls for regulation but doesn't specify alternatives to the business model
- **US-centric**: Framework developed around US tech firms; less clear how it applies to Chinese model

## Influence

### Academic
- "Surveillance capitalism" widely adopted as analytical term
- Influenced EU regulatory thinking (GDPR, DSA)
- Cited in internet governance debates globally

### Policy
- Referenced in EU digital regulation design
- Informs privacy advocacy
- Framework used by regulators worldwide

### Public Discourse
- Made tech power legible to non-technical audience
- Influenced journalism about Big Tech
- Gave vocabulary to concerns about data extraction

## Concepts Developed/Popularized
- [[Surveillance Capitalism]]
- [[Internet Geopolitics]] (market/corporate power dimension)
- [[Digital Colonialism]] (data extraction as North-South issue)

## Comparison to Other Thinkers

| Thinker | Relationship |
|---------|-------------|
| [[Lawrence Lessig]] | Lessig identified architecture as power; Zuboff identified business model as power |
| [[Milton Mueller]] | Mueller focuses on state power; Zuboff on corporate power |
| [[Michael Kwet]] | Kwet extends Zuboff's logic to Global South imperial relations |
| Evgeny Morozov | Both critique tech industry, but Morozov more structural/Marxist |
| Frank Pasquale | Complementary - Pasquale focuses on algorithmic accountability |
