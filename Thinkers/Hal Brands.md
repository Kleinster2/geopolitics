## January 2026 Analysis

### "The World Order Is Becoming More Cutthroat"
Bloomberg Opinion piece that synthesized multiple symptoms of liberal order erosion:

#### Key Arguments

**Symptoms of Collapse**
- Superpower snatching foreign leaders (Maduro)
- Borders threatened (Greenland, Ukraine)
- [[Arms Control]] unraveling
- [[Freedom of Navigation]] challenged
- Rules-based trading system dying

**The [[State Death]] Statistic**
> "Between 1816 and 1945, a quarter of the world's states simply vanished from the map at some point. Since 1945, 'state death' has become vanishingly rare."

**Trump's Calculation**
- More competitive world benefits strongest player
- US has greatest [[Spheres of Influence|sphere of influence]] potential
- If order can't be sustained, seize largest share of loot

**The [[Melian Dialogue]] Warning**
If US makes "the strong do what they will" its ethos:
- Loses global legitimacy
- Fractures alliances (NATO/Greenland)
- Long-term costs outweigh short-term gains

**The Verdict**
> "Trump is betting that American power and well-being will survive, even soar, after the demise of the US order. In typically Trumpian fashion, he won't be around to pay the price if the wager fails."

## Analytical Framework

### On Grand Strategy
- Strategy requires matching ends, ways, means
- US often lacks strategic coherence
- Historical perspective essential
- Tragedy is inherent in great power politics

### On US-China
- Competition is structural, unavoidable
- But war not inevitable
- Policy choices matter
- Need sustained commitment

### On Liberal Order
- Worth defending but under strain
- US commitment wavering
- Challengers gaining
- Reform needed, not abandonment

- Bipartisan audience

## February 2026: Geography Is Still Destiny

### "In an Age of Superpowers, Geography Is Still Destiny"
Bloomberg Opinion piece (February 1, 2026) arguing for return to geopolitical thinking as great-power competition intensifies.

#### Core Thesis
> "Geography isn't quite destiny, but it is the most elemental foundation of international relations."

Innovation shifts geography's *meaning* but doesn't eliminate it. Post-Cold War "end of geography" was illusion - Afghanistan terrain defeated hyperpower; Chinese missiles exploit Pacific distances.

#### Key Geographic Frameworks

**Ukraine - "Strategic Hinge of Supercontinent"**
- Lies on pathway between Eurasian [[Heartland Theory|Heartland]] and European [[Rimland]]
- Black Sea access links Russia to Mediterranean
- Name itself means "borderland"
- Has been invasion target in every great-power contest for generations

**Taiwan - Double Barrier**
- Heart of [[First Island Chain]]
- Confluence of South China Sea and East China Sea
- If free: bottles up Chinese power, breaks unity of China's seaboard
- If taken: blasts hole in containment, becomes springboard to open Pacific

**Russia - Geography Breeds Expansion**
- Open terrain = invasion route from Europe and Asia alike
- "Security through violent expansion" transcends regimes and ideologies
- Cites Kennan: "conceptions of offense and defense inextricably confused"
- Russia's rulers can only see nearby states as "buffers, vassals or enemies"

**China - Amphibious Geography**
- Huge Eurasian hinterland + Pacific frontage
- "Most dangerous sort of country—one that can plausibly seek dominance in two domains"
- [[Belt and Road Initiative]] = continental hegemony
- Naval buildup = reclaiming Ming Dynasty oceanic grandeur
- If Beijing succeeds: "hybrid hegemony" ending American Century

**United States - Geographic Ambivalence**
- Oceans served as shields when young, conveyor belts when strong
- Distance from Old World made US attractive ally (non-threatening)
- Same geography creates enduring temptation to retrench
- Trump tapping "older, more unilateral tradition... dating back generations, even centuries"

**India as Barrier**
- "Madness" for US-India feud
- Indian Ocean coastline + Himalayan frontier = barrier to Chinese power on land and sea

#### Strategic Implications
- US must exploit "natural tendencies of resistance" Russia/China inspire in neighbors
- Design ways of war making Western Pacific "death-trap for invasion fleets"
- Recognize expansionist impulses are geographically ingrained—may persist after Xi/Putin depart
