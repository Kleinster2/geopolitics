## January 2026 Analysis

### "The World Order Is Becoming More Cutthroat"
Bloomberg Opinion piece that synthesized multiple symptoms of liberal order erosion:

#### Key Arguments

**Symptoms of Collapse**
- Superpower snatching foreign leaders (Maduro)
- Borders threatened (Greenland, Ukraine)
- [[Arms Control]] unraveling
- [[Freedom of Navigation]] challenged
- Rules-based trading system dying

**The [[State Death]] Statistic**
> "Between 1816 and 1945, a quarter of the world's states simply vanished from the map at some point. Since 1945, 'state death' has become vanishingly rare."

**Trump's Calculation**
- More competitive world benefits strongest player
- US has greatest [[Spheres of Influence|sphere of influence]] potential
- If order can't be sustained, seize largest share of loot

**The [[Melian Dialogue]] Warning**
If US makes "the strong do what they will" its ethos:
- Loses global legitimacy
- Fractures alliances (NATO/Greenland)
- Long-term costs outweigh short-term gains

**The Verdict**
> "Trump is betting that American power and well-being will survive, even soar, after the demise of the US order. In typically Trumpian fashion, he won't be around to pay the price if the wager fails."

## Analytical Framework

### On Grand Strategy

- US often lacks strategic coherence
- Historical perspective essential
- Tragedy is inherent in great power politics

### On US-China

- Challengers gaining
- Reform needed, not abandonment
