# Michael Kwet

## Overview

Scholar of technology and society whose 2019 article "Digital Colonialism" in *Race & Class* established the primary framework for understanding how US tech corporations extend imperial power relations through control of digital infrastructure in the Global South.

## Key Facts
- **Position**: Visiting Fellow, Yale Information Society Project; affiliated with University of Johannesburg
- **Education**: PhD, Rhodes University (South Africa)
- **Orientation**: Anti-imperialist, technology justice advocate
- **Focus area**: Southern Africa, Global South digital dependency

## Major Works

### "Digital Colonialism: US Empire and the New Imperialism in the Global South" (*Race & Class*, 2019)
Core argument: US tech corporations exercise imperial control at the architecture level, producing five forms of domination:

1. **Monopoly extraction** - Concentrated corporate control
2. **Control of computer-mediated experience** - Platforms determine access
3. **Surveillance capitalism** - Behavioral data extraction (see [[Surveillance Capitalism]])
4. **Imperial state surveillance** - NSA/Five Eyes infrastructure
5. **Tech hegemony** - Standards embed US political values

### "People's Tech for People's Power" (various, 2020+)
Counter-proposal advocating:
- Open-source infrastructure
- Community-owned networks
- Democratic data governance
- South-South technology cooperation

### Research on South Africa
Detailed case studies of how US tech platforms (Google, Microsoft, Facebook) dominate South African education, government, and civil society - creating dependency at the institutional level.

## Analytical Framework

### Architecture-Level Control
Kwet's key contribution is identifying that digital imperialism operates at the *infrastructure* level, not just the content level:

| Layer | Control Mechanism | Example |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| Hardware | Device market dominance | Android/iOS duopoly |
| Software | Platform dependency | Google in education |
| Connectivity | Cable/satellite ownership | Submarine cable routes |
| Data | Extraction without compensation | Training data from Global South |
| Standards | Protocol design | US-dominated IETF/IEEE |

This distinguishes his framework from content-focused analyses (censorship, misinformation) - the problem is structural, not merely about what content flows.

### Distinction from "Data Colonialism"
Nick Couldry & Ulises Mejias (2019) also use colonial language but focus on data extraction specifically. Kwet's framework is broader - it's about control of the entire digital stack, not just data.

## Critiques

- **Agency problem**: Understates choices made by Global South states and populations
- **Coherence problem**: Treats US tech firms as unified imperial project when they compete intensely
- **Alternatives unclear**: Open-source community networks haven't scaled
- **Colonialism analogy**: No territorial occupation, no direct political rule - is "colonialism" the right frame?
- **China gap**: Framework focused on US empire; less clear on whether Chinese infrastructure (Digital Silk Road) is better or just different imperialism

## Influence

### Academic
- Established "digital colonialism" as legitimate analytical framework
- Cited in internet governance scholarship globally
- Influences African digital policy discourse

### Policy
- Referenced in African Union digital strategy discussions
- Informs Global South positions in WSIS/IGF
- Supports open-source policy advocacy

## Concepts Developed/Popularized
- [[Digital Colonialism]] (primary framework developer)
- [[Internet Geopolitics]] (Global South perspective)

## Comparison to Other Thinkers

| Thinker | Relationship |
|---------|-------------|
| [[Shoshana Zuboff]] | Kwet extends Zuboff's surveillance capitalism to imperial relations |
| [[Milton Mueller]] | Mueller focuses on state vs. network; Kwet on North vs. South |
| Couldry & Mejias | Similar colonial framing but narrower (data only vs. full stack) |
| Morozov | Both anti-imperial tech critics, Morozov more focused on ideology |
