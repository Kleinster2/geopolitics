## Overview
Dartmouth College political scientist specializing in nuclear strategy, coercion, and military power. Frequent collaborator with [[Keir Lieber]] on influential work about nuclear primacy and first-strike stability. Also known for work on the credibility of threats.

See [[Keir Lieber]] for full discussion. Key joint works:

Argued that nuclear balance is not automatically stable, counterforce capabilities matter, and US may have achievable nuclear primacy over Russia/China.

### Calculating Credibility

- Implications for extended deterrence, alliance commitments

Research on when coercive threats work:
