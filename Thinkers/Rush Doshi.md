## Major Works

### The Long Game (2021)

*The Long Game: China's Grand Strategy to Displace American Order* - Doshi's landmark work based on extensive analysis of Chinese Communist Party documents, speeches, and strategic writings.

#### Core Argument

China has pursued a coherent grand strategy since Tiananmen (1989) to:
1. **Blunt** American power in Asia
2. **Build** Chinese capabilities and influence
3. **Expand** globally as US weakens

This is not improvisation—it's deliberate, documented, and decades in the making.

#### Three Phases

| Phase | Period | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Blunting** | 1989-2008 | Counter US intervention capability, hide and bide |
| **Building** | 2008-2016 | Develop regional order, institutions, military |
| **Expanding** | 2016-present | Global ambitions, Belt and Road, alternative order |

#### Key Sources

Doshi's method: systematic analysis of:
- CCP leadership speeches and documents
- Military strategic writings
- Internal debates and assessments
- Policy implementation patterns

This documentary approach distinguishes his work from speculation about Chinese intentions.

## Analytical Framework

### Displacement Strategy

China seeks to displace US from three forms of order:

1. **Military**: Undermine US alliance system, A2/AD, push US beyond First Island Chain
2. **Political**: Alternative governance models, regional institutions under Chinese leadership
3. **Economic**: BRI, AIIB, trade networks centered on China

### Learning from US Hegemony

Doshi argues China studied how the US built its order and is replicating the playbook:
- Hub-and-spoke relationships
- Institutional frameworks
- Military presence
- Economic integration

### On Two-Domain Challenge

Doshi's analysis supports the view that China pursues **both continental and maritime** dominance:
- Maritime: Regional military hegemony, Pacific presence
- Continental: BRI as Eurasian integration project

This documentary evidence grounds [[Hal Brands]]' "hybrid hegemony" concept.

## Influence

### Policy Impact

- Others note gap between stated intentions and actual capabilities
- Debate over how much internal documents reflect real policy
