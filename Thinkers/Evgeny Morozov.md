# Evgeny Morozov

## Overview
Belarusian-American writer and technology critic. Leading skeptic of "technological solutionism" and Western internet freedom ideology. Argues that technology debates obscure deeper political economy questions and that Silicon Valley's framing serves American geopolitical interests.

## Key Contributions

### Critique of Internet Freedom
*The Net Delusion* (2011) attacked Western assumptions that internet inherently promotes democracy:
- Authoritarian regimes use internet for surveillance and propaganda
- "Twitter revolutions" overstated; tech determinism is naive
- Internet can strengthen dictatorships as easily as weaken them
- US "internet freedom" agenda serves geopolitical interests, not universal values

### Technological Solutionism
*To Save Everything, Click Here* (2013) coined "solutionism":
- Tendency to frame every problem as having a technological fix
- Silicon Valley ideology obscures political choices
- "Disruption" rhetoric serves corporate interests
- Many "problems" don't need solving or shouldn't be solved by tech

### Political Economy of Technology
Later work focuses on:
- Data as new form of capital
- Platform monopolies and market power
- Tech colonialism (Western platforms extracting value from Global South)
- Need for public alternatives to private platforms

## Intellectual Position

### Against Cyber-Utopianism
Morozov criticizes both:
- **Right**: Market fundamentalism, "innovation" worship
- **Left**: Naive belief in internet's liberating potential

### Structural Analysis
Argues tech debates miss the point:
- Focus on "bad actors" (Russian bots, Facebook) avoids structural critique
- Platform capitalism is the problem, not specific platform behaviors
- Regulation debates accept tech industry framing
- Need to question whether platforms should exist, not just how to regulate them

## Controversies
- Combative style; criticized fellow tech writers
- Accused of excessive pessimism
- Debates with [[Tim Wu]], Jeff Jarvis, others
- Some view his critiques as better at diagnosis than prescription

## Key Works
- *The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom* (2011)
- *To Save Everything, Click Here* (2013)
- Regular columns in The Guardian, FAZ, other outlets

## Contemporary Relevance

### Platform Power
His warnings about platform monopolies now mainstream concern:
- Antitrust debates
- Content moderation controversies
- Data privacy
- AI governance

### Geopolitics of Technology
His critique of "internet freedom" as geopolitical tool relevant to:
- US-China tech competition
- Debates over TikTok, Huawei
- European digital sovereignty
- Global South perspectives on tech governance
