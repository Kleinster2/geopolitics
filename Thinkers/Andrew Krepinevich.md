- Archipelagic defense concepts for Western Pacific
- Competitive strategies framework

## Analytical Framework

### Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD)

Krepinevich was among the first to articulate the strategic challenge posed by A2/AD:

- China (and Russia) investing in missiles, submarines, air defenses to deny US access to key regions
- US forward bases vulnerable to precision strike
- Traditional power projection model breaking down
- Requires fundamental rethinking of US military posture

### Archipelagic Defense

Response to A2/AD challenge in Western Pacific:
- Distribute forces across First Island Chain
- Small, dispersed, hard-to-target units
- Let geography work for defense (island terrain)
- Deny China ability to achieve quick fait accompli

### Competitive Strategies

Drawing on Cold War Office of Net Assessment work:
- Identify adversary weaknesses
- Impose costs in areas where US has advantages
- Force adversary into expensive, dead-end investments
- Long-term strategic competition, not single battles

## On China

Krepinevich argues China presents a two-domain challenge:

- **Maritime**: Naval buildup threatens to push US beyond First Island Chain
- **Continental**: Belt and Road extends influence across Eurasia

US must compete in both domains but prioritize based on relative advantage. Maritime/aerospace are traditional US strengths; ground forces in Eurasia favor China/Russia.

This analysis informs [[Hal Brands]]' concern about China's "hybrid hegemony" potential.
