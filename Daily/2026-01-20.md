## Verification Notes
| Zeihan Claim | Verification Status |
|--------------|-------------------|
| China shrinking 6M/year | **Incorrect** - Official data shows 3.39M in 2025 |
| Shanghai Academy overcount debate | **Partially confirmed** - 100M figure cited in press |
| US birth rate > China since 1991 | **Disputed** - Depends on data adjustment methodology |
| European nuclear discussions happening | **Confirmed** - Tusk, Merz, Macron statements on record |
| Joint chiefs ordered to draw up Greenland plans | **Unverified** - No independent confirmation |

## Follow-ups
- Track European nuclear debate developments
- Monitor China 2026 population data when released
- Watch for any independent confirmation of Greenland military planning claims
