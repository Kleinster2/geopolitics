## Key Developments

- **Horn of Africa / Tigray re-escalation**: Ethiopian federal forces moving toward Tigray province. ICG (Feb 19) warned risk of renewed conflict is high. Tigray regional admin rejected federal election suspension as "direct attack on our people" (Feb 25). The broader conflict system features two rival blocs: UAE-Ethiopia-Israel vs Saudi-Egypt-Turkey-Eritrea-Somalia. Potential for state-on-state war (Eritrea switching to fight alongside TPLF). Egypt reportedly proposes Red Sea access for Ethiopia in exchange for GERD water deal (per The National). Somalia signed defense cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia (Feb 9).
