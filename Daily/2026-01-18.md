## Key Themes from Transcripts

### WW Especial (CNN Brasil) - Trump's First Year

**Trump domestic standing (Moura):**
- Entered with ~50% approval, lost 10-12 points in one year
- Three drivers: DOGE disruption, immigration excess, tariff costs
- Democrats won 2025 elections on cost of living messaging
- Only 10-12 swing districts will decide 2026 midterms

**Economic analysis (Dumas):**
- Tariffs won't achieve reindustrialization (comparative advantage)
- Twin deficits identity means fiscal expansion → trade deficit
- Fed independence attacks threaten global bond pricing
- Brazil trade: -6% to US, +6% to China

**Venezuela intervention model (Loureiro):**
- Low-cost alternative to Iraq model
- Uses existing regime structure rather than dismantling it

**US-China (all):**
- Bipartisan consensus on China threat (rare DC agreement)
- AI competition now central strategic focus
- China only country to fully escalate on tariffs
- Rare earths demonstrated effective counter-leverage

**Brazil-US (Moura):**
- Private sector lobbying replaced state-to-state diplomacy
- Trump did not intervene on Bolsonaro's behalf
- Lula engaged with Trump pre-Venezuela operation

**Audit note:** Removed unverifiable insider claims and psychological speculation (Moura's "ego and cash" framework, claims about Rubio/Vance factions, Trump's motivations). Kept verifiable facts, trade data, and testable analytical frameworks.

### Iran
- Trump set red line ("help is on the way") but backed off strike
- Three strike options: (1) limited support, (2) wider IRGC destabilization, (3) ballistic missiles
- Israeli/Arab allies pressured US not to strike
- Military assets not in position (Venezuela redeployment)
- Tucker Carlson restrainer influence at White House

### Greenland
- Trump: "psychological" need to own, not just lease
- Existing treaty allows reopening 15-16 US bases
- Real estate developer mentality

### Venezuela
- Machado gave Nobel medal as gratitude gesture
- Trump confused medal ownership with laureate status
- Nobel Committee: prizes cannot be transferred

### US Military Posture
- Strikes since Christmas: Nigeria, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela
- One-and-done pattern (except Yemen)
- Carrier repositioning causing gaps

### Domestic
- Insurrection Act threats against Minneapolis
- DOJ investigating MN governor and Minneapolis mayor
- Military deeply reluctant to be used politically

## Follow-ups

### Completed
- ~~Track Compass Points debut~~ ✓ Processed inaugural episode
- ~~Research Honduras president pardon~~ ✓ **Verified**: Juan Orlando Hernández, pardoned Dec 1, 2025, 400+ tons cocaine trafficking conviction
- ~~Create Defense Priorities note~~ ✓ Done
- ~~Alaska summit reference~~ ✓ **Verified**: Trump-Putin summit Aug 15, 2025, Anchorage; follow-up was Aug 18 White House meeting with European leaders
- ~~Hague Summit date~~ ✓ **Corrected**: June 24-25, 2025 (Coates was wrong about April)
- ~~Iran bank failures~~ ✓ **Confirmed**: Ayandeh Bank collapse, ~$5B losses, "Ponzi scheme," 5 other banks fragile

### Ongoing
- Monitor Iran situation for renewed strike threats
- Track Minneapolis/Insurrection Act developments
- ~~Consider note on Jerome Powell/Fed independence pushback~~ ✓ Created [[Federal Reserve Independence]]

### Key Corrections Made
1. **Coates error on Hague Summit date**: She said April, actually June 24-25, 2025
2. **Death toll update**: Now 12,000-18,000+ (much higher than earlier 2,500 estimates)
3. **Bank failure confirmed**: Ayandeh Bank collapse independently verified, not just Coates' claim
