## Key Developments

### Greenland: Davos De-escalation
- **Trump ruled out military force** and **dropped tariff threats** in Davos speech
- Announced "framework of a future deal" with NATO chief Mark Rutte
- Framework covers military cooperation + mineral development (both already exist)
- Called Greenland "part of North America," mistakenly referred to it as "Iceland" 4 times
- Treasury Sec Bessent: Greenland "essential for Golden Dome Missile Shield"

**Danish response**: FM Rasmussen said "positive" force is off table but "president's ambition is intact"

**EU retaliation**: Parliament halted approval of July 2025 trade deal

**Public protests**: "Hands off Greenland" demonstrations in Denmark and Greenland

### Davos: Carney on Global Rupture
Canadian PM Mark Carney:
> "We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition. Over the past two decades, a series of crises in finance, health, energy and geopolitics have laid bare the risks of extreme global integration."

> "Sovereignty will no longer rest on rules but on the ability to withstand pressure."

### China Economic

## Notes Created

## Notes Updated
- [[Greenland Crisis]] - Added Davos de-escalation section (Jan 21): Trump drops force/tariffs, Rutte "framework," EU halts trade deal, Danish response, protests

## Sources Consulted
- Washington Post: Trump Greenland crusade, Davos speech
- NPR: Trump backs off tariff threats

## Follow-ups

- Track EU trade deal status - will they resume approval?
- Watch for Trump's next pivot (Zeihan's "distraction" theory in action?)
