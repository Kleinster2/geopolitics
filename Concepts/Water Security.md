# Water Security

## Overview
The reliable availability of acceptable quantity and quality of water for health, livelihoods, ecosystems, and production. Increasingly critical as climate change, population growth, and development strain freshwater resources. Potential driver of conflict, cooperation, and migration. Transboundary water governance growing geopolitical importance.

## Why Water Matters

### Fundamental Resource
- No substitute exists
- Agriculture (70% use)
- Industry
- Drinking/sanitation
- Ecosystems

### Growing Stress
- Climate change
- Population growth
- Economic development
- Pollution
- Overextraction

## Water Stress Hotspots

### Most Vulnerable Regions
| Region | Key Issues |
|--------|------------|
| Middle East/North Africa | Scarcity, transboundary |
| South Asia | Glacial melt, demand |
| Central Asia | Soviet legacy, allocation |
| Sahel | Climate, conflict |
| Horn of Africa | Drought, development |

### Countries at Risk
- Yemen (extreme scarcity)
- Jordan, Israel/Palestine
- Egypt (Nile dependence)
- India, Pakistan
- Iraq (Tigris-Euphrates)

## Transboundary Water

### Scale
- 310 transboundary river basins
- 40% global population
- 60% freshwater flows
- Requires cooperation

### Key Disputes

#### Nile Basin
- **Parties**: Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia
- **Issue**: GERD dam (Ethiopia)
- **Stakes**: Existential for Egypt
- **Status**: Unresolved tensions
- See: [[Ethiopia]], [[Egypt]]

#### Tigris-Euphrates
- **Parties**: Turkey, Syria, Iraq
- **Issue**: Turkish dams
- **Stakes**: Iraqi agriculture
- **Status**: Ongoing tensions

#### Indus Basin
- **Parties**: India, Pakistan
- **Issue**: Indus Waters Treaty
- **Stakes**: Pakistan agriculture
- **Status**: Treaty under strain

#### Mekong River
- **Parties**: China, downstream states
- **Issue**: Chinese dams
- **Stakes**: Southeast Asia
- **Status**: Governance weak

#### Jordan River
- **Parties**: Israel, Jordan, Palestine
- **Issue**: Allocation, access
- **Stakes**: Scarce region
- **Status**: Unequal access

## Climate Change Impact

### Effects
- Precipitation changes
- Glacier melt
- Sea level rise (salinization)
- Extreme events
- Seasonal shifts

### Glacial Water Towers
- Himalayas serve billions
- Andes, Alps, others
- Melt trajectory
- Long-term decline

### Intensification
- Wet regions wetter
- Dry regions drier
- Extreme droughts
- Extreme floods

## Water and Conflict

### Debates
- "Water wars" predicted
- History: more cooperation than conflict
- But: local violence occurs
- Climate may change calculus

### Conflict Pathways
- Resource scarcity
- Development disputes
- Dam construction
- Agricultural pressure
- Migration driver

### Historical Cases
- Generally cooperation
- Treaties more common
- But: power asymmetries
- And: climate stress new

## Water and Migration

### Driver
- Agricultural failure
- Livelihood loss
- Climate migration
- Rural-urban
- International

### Examples
- Syria (pre-conflict drought)
- Sahel
- Central America
- South Asia

## Infrastructure as Power

### Dams
- Water control
- Energy generation
- Leverage over downstream
- Unilateral development

### Examples
- GERD (Ethiopia-Egypt)
- Chinese Mekong dams
- Turkish dams
- Indian projects

### Weaponization
- Deliberate manipulation
- Conflict tool
- Infrastructure targeting
- Documented cases (Syria, Ukraine)

## Water Governance

### International Law
- 1997 UN Convention (limited ratification)
- Customary principles
- Equitable use
- No significant harm
- Weak enforcement

### Basin Organizations
- Mekong River Commission
- Nile Basin Initiative
- Indus Commission
- Varying effectiveness

### Challenges
- Sovereignty claims
- Power asymmetries
- Climate uncertainty
- Enforcement gaps

## Solutions and Adaptation

### Technical
- Efficiency improvements
- Desalination
- Recycling/reuse
- Infrastructure
- Monitoring

### Governance
- Treaties
- Joint management
- Benefit sharing
- Data sharing
- Conflict prevention

### Challenges
- Cost
- Energy for desalination
- Political will
- Capacity
- Equity

## Strategic Implications

### For Stability
- Stress multiplier
- Migration driver
- Conflict potential
- Cooperation opportunity

### For Development
- Agriculture constraints
- Energy-water nexus
- Urban sustainability
- Economic limits

### For Policy
- Climate adaptation
- Infrastructure investment
- Governance frameworks
- Early warning
