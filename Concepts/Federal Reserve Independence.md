# Federal Reserve Independence

## Overview
The principle that central banks should operate free from political pressure on monetary policy decisions. Trump's 2025-2026 attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell represent the most significant challenge to Fed independence since Nixon's pressure on Arthur Burns in the 1970s. Unlike most institutional attacks, this has global implications because US Treasury securities serve as the global pricing benchmark.

## Why Independence Matters

### Time Inconsistency Problem

Roberto Dumas (Insper economist) cites Kydland and Prescott (2004 Nobel laureates) on "dynamic inconsistency":

1. Government announces 3% inflation target
2. Rational agents adjust wages to 3%
3. Government delivers 5-10% inflation
4. Short-term: production costs fall, GDP rises (workers undercompensated)
5. Medium-term: agents anticipate cheating, demand 10% wage increases
6. Result: inflation expectations unanchored, credibility destroyed

**Historical examples:**
- **Brazil (Dilma era):** Announced 4.5% target, delivered ~10%. Workers stopped believing; GDP fell 8%
- **Turkey:** Erdogan interference destroyed lira credibility
- **US (Nixon-Burns):** Fed chair Arthur Burns cut rates before 1973-74 election at Nixon's request; inflation hit 10-11%

## Trump's Challenge to Fed Independence

### Campaign Promise

Per Maurício Moura (George Washington University), who attended both 2024 party conventions:
> "Ending the independence of the Central Bank" was explicitly discussed at Republican events

### Actions (2025-2026)

- Demanded 1% interest rates (inflation at 2.7%—economically nonsensical per Dumas)
- Attempted to remove Fed board member (legal challenge)
- Public attacks on Jerome Powell
- Framing Powell as obstacle to economic growth

### Powell's Response

Powell resisting publicly.

## Global Implications (Dumas Analysis)

**Why US Fed is different from other central banks:**

> "We're not talking about a banana republic... If you minimize the independence of the Central Bank, it doesn't affect asset pricing around the world. But when you make it more or less clear that you want to intervene in monetary policy... you get scared because it means you no longer know how to price public and corporate bonds around the world."

**Key insight:** Turkey or Argentina losing central bank independence is a local problem. The US losing Fed independence affects global financial architecture—Treasuries are the benchmark for pricing risk worldwide.

## Historical Precedents

### Arthur Burns (1970-1978)

Nixon pressured Burns to cut rates before 1972 election:
- Fed eased aggressively
- Combined with wage/price controls
- Inflation hit 10%+
- Paul Volcker eventually forced to implement painful correction (1979-82)
- Result: Latin American debt crisis (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico collapsed)

### Brazil's Central Bank

Dilma Rousseff era demonstrated consequences:
- Politicized monetary policy
- Market lost confidence in inflation targets
- Wage-price spiral
- Deep recession

## 2026 Status

- Jerome Powell tenure continues
- Legal challenges to removal underway
- Republican senators quietly pushing back
- Markets pricing in elevated uncertainty
