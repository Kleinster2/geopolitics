# Grand Strategy

## Definition
A state's overarching theory about how to produce security and achieve its highest-priority goals through the coordinated use of all instruments of national power - military, economic, diplomatic, and informational.

## Key Thinkers
- Basil Liddell Hart
- Edward Luttwak
- John Lewis Gaddis
- Hal Brands
- Barry Posen

## Core Elements

### Ends
- What are the state's vital interests?
- What is the desired end state?
- How is security defined?

### Means
- Military power
- Economic resources
- Diplomatic influence
- Information/soft power
- Alliance networks

### Ways
- How to employ means to achieve ends?
- Sequencing and prioritization
- Risk management

## American Grand Strategy Debates

### Post-Cold War Options

#### Liberal Hegemony/Primacy
- Maintain US dominance
- Spread democracy
- Deep engagement
- Forward military presence
- Critics: Overstretch, costs

#### Offshore Balancing
- Regional balance maintenance
- Intervene only when necessary
- Shift burden to allies
- Reduce commitments
- Advocates: Mearsheimer, Walt

#### Restraint
- Reduce global commitments
- Nation-building at home
- Avoid unnecessary wars
- Let regions self-balance
- Advocates: Posen, Preble

#### Selective Engagement
- Focus on vital regions (Europe, Asia, ME)
- Maintain key alliances
- Avoid peripheral conflicts
- Balance costs and interests

### Current Trajectory
- Great power competition focus
- China as "pacing threat"
- Integrated deterrence
- Alliance revitalization
- Selective retrenchment (Middle East)

## Historical Examples

### Containment (Cold War)
- George Kennan's "Long Telegram"
- Soviet expansion prevention
- Military, economic, ideological tools
- Adapted over time (NSC-68 militarization)

### British Imperial Strategy
- Balance of power on continent
- Naval supremacy
- Colonial empire
- "Splendid isolation" option

### Chinese Grand Strategy
- "Rejuvenation" by 2049
- Regional then global influence
- BRI as tool
- Military modernization
- "Hide and bide" → assertiveness

## Strategy-Making Challenges

### Coherence Problem
- Multiple agencies, competing interests
- Political system constraints
- Short-term pressures
- Bureaucratic politics

### Uncertainty
- Future unknowable
- Adversary adaptation
- Technology change
- Black swans

### Resource Constraints
- Guns vs. butter
- Prioritization required
- Opportunity costs
- Domestic sustainability

### Implementation Gap
- Strategy ≠ execution
- Bureaucratic resistance
- Allied cooperation
- Adversary countermoves

## Evaluating Grand Strategy

### Criteria
1. **Coherence**: Ends-means alignment
2. **Feasibility**: Within resource constraints
3. **Sustainability**: Domestic support
4. **Flexibility**: Adapt to change
5. **Effectiveness**: Achieves goals
