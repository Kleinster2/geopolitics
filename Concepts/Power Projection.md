# Power Projection

## Definition
The ability of a state to deploy and sustain military forces outside its borders to achieve strategic objectives. The hallmark of great power status and essential for global influence.

## Why It Matters for Geopolitics

### Enables
- Defend allies far from home
- Protect sea lanes and trade
- Respond to crises globally
- Deter adversaries in their regions
- Intervene in conflicts

### Signals
- Commitment credibility
- Great power status
- Alliance reliability
- Global interests

## Components

### Force Elements
- **Carrier Strike Groups**: Mobile airfields
- **Amphibious Forces**: Ship-to-shore assault
- **Long-Range Strike**: Bombers, missiles
- **Airlift/Sealift**: Strategic transport
- **Special Operations**: Precision intervention
- **Forward Bases**: Pre-positioned access

### Enablers
- **Logistics**: "Amateurs talk tactics, professionals talk logistics"
- **Overseas Bases**: Forward presence
- **Alliances**: Host nation support
- **Aerial Refueling**: Extended range
- **Prepositioned Stocks**: Equipment forward deployed
- **Sealift Capacity**: Heavy equipment transport

## Tiers of Power Projection

### Tier 1: Global
- Sustained operations anywhere
- Multiple theaters simultaneously
- Only: **United States**

### Tier 2: Extended Regional
- Operations beyond immediate neighborhood
- Limited duration or scope
- **UK, France, Russia, China** (emerging)

### Tier 3: Regional
- Operations in neighborhood
- Limited expeditionary capability
- **India, Japan, Australia, Turkey, Israel**

### Tier 4: Limited
- Defensive focus
- Minimal expeditionary capacity
- Most states

## US Power Projection

### Unique Capabilities
- 11 aircraft carriers (next largest: 2)
- 750+ overseas bases
- Global logistics network
- Aerial refueling fleet
- Strategic airlift (C-5, C-17)
- Prepositioned stocks globally

### Reach
- Can strike anywhere in 24-48 hours
- Sustain major operations indefinitely
- Multiple theaters simultaneously
- "Global commons" dominance

### Challenges
- Cost
- Distance to Indo-Pacific
- A2/AD threats
- Domestic political will

## China's Growing Projection

### Development
- Aircraft carriers (3, growing)
- Overseas base (Djibouti)
- PLAN expansion
- Long-range missiles

### Limitations
- Limited basing
- Logistics inexperience
- Regional focus (for now)
- First/second island chain focus

### Trajectory
- Indian Ocean ambitions
- BRI port network (dual-use?)
- 2049 goals

## Key Platforms

### Aircraft Carriers
| Country | Carriers | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| United States | 11 | Nuclear, supercarriers |
| China | 3 | Conventional, building |
| UK | 2 | Queen Elizabeth class |
| France | 1 | Nuclear (Charles de Gaulle) |
| India | 2 | Expanding |
| Russia | 1 | Limited readiness |

### Amphibious Assault
- US: 30+ amphibious ships
- China: Rapidly expanding
- Others: Limited

### Strategic Bombers
- US: B-52, B-1, B-2, B-21
- Russia: Tu-95, Tu-160
- China: H-6 (limited range)

## Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD)

### Concept
Prevent adversary power projection through:
- Long-range missiles
- Submarines
- Mines
- Air defense
- Cyber/electronic warfare

### Practitioners
- China (vs. US in Pacific)
- Russia (Kaliningrad, Black Sea)
- Iran (Persian Gulf)

### Impact
- Raises intervention costs
- Complicates US guarantees
- Regional denial strategies

## Overseas Basing

### US Global Footprint
- ~750 bases in 80 countries
- Major hubs: Japan, Germany, Gulf
- Rotational presence expanding

### Other Powers
- UK: Cyprus, Diego Garcia, Gibraltar
- France: Africa, Pacific territories
- Russia: Syria, Central Asia
- China: Djibouti (only official)

### Base Politics
- Host nation relations
- Sovereignty concerns
- Cost burden
- Status of forces agreements

## Power Projection in Action

### Examples
| Operation | Distance | Scale |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Desert Storm (1991) | 10,000 km | 500,000 troops |
| Afghanistan (2001+) | 12,000 km | Sustained 20 years |
| Libya (2011) | 3,000 km | Air campaign |
| French Sahel | 4,000 km | Counter-terror |

## Geopolitical Implications

### Alliance Credibility
- Can you actually defend allies?
- Article 5, Taiwan scenarios
- Distance and logistics matter

### Regional Balances
- External power intervention capacity
- Local powers' denial strategies
- Escalation dynamics

### Great Power Competition
- US vs. China in Indo-Pacific
- Access and basing competition
- Logistics and sustainment race
