# UNCLOS (UN Convention on the Law of the Sea)

## Overview
The "constitution of the oceans" - comprehensive treaty governing all uses of the seas. Establishes maritime zones, navigation rights, resource jurisdiction, and dispute resolution. Ratified by 169 parties but notably **not the United States**, which nonetheless treats it as customary international law.

## Key Facts
- **Adopted**: 1982
- **Entered into Force**: 1994
- **Parties**: 169 states + EU
- **Notable Non-Party**: United States
- **Administering Body**: International Seabed Authority

## Maritime Zones

```
LAND → Territorial Sea → Contiguous Zone → EEZ → High Seas
       (0-12 nm)         (12-24 nm)        (12-200 nm)   (beyond)
```

### Territorial Sea (0-12 nautical miles)
- Full sovereignty (like land)
- **Innocent passage** permitted for foreign ships
- No weapons use, no intelligence gathering
- Submarines must surface

### Contiguous Zone (12-24 nm)
- Limited enforcement rights
- Customs, immigration, sanitary laws
- Not full sovereignty

### Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (12-200 nm)
- Sovereign rights over resources (fish, oil, minerals)
- **Navigation freedom preserved**
- No territorial sovereignty
- Can regulate fishing, drilling

### Continental Shelf (to 350 nm or more)
- Seabed/subsoil rights
- Can extend beyond 200 nm with geological proof
- Russia, Canada, Denmark claiming Arctic extensions

### High Seas (beyond EEZ)
- Freedom of navigation
- Freedom of fishing (with limits)
- Freedom of scientific research
- No state sovereignty

## Navigation Rights

### Innocent Passage
- Through territorial seas
- Must be "continuous and expeditious"
- No threat or use of force
- No weapons exercises
- Submarines must surface and show flag

### Transit Passage
- Through international straits
- Cannot be suspended
- Normal mode (submarines can stay submerged)
- Critical for naval operations

### Archipelagic Sea Lanes Passage
- Through archipelagic states (Indonesia, Philippines)
- Similar to transit passage
- Designated corridors

## Key Provisions

### Dispute Resolution
- International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS)
- Arbitration tribunals
- Binding decisions
- China rejected South China Sea ruling (2016)

### Deep Seabed
- "Common heritage of mankind"
- International Seabed Authority manages
- Mining regulations
- Revenue sharing

### Marine Environment
- Pollution prevention
- Conservation obligations
- Climate change relevance

## US Position

### Why Not Ratified?
- Seabed mining provisions (Reagan objection)
- Sovereignty concerns (conservatives)
- Senate never voted
- Despite Navy, State Dept support

### Treats as Customary Law
- Follows most provisions
- Conducts FONOPs based on UNCLOS rights
- Recognizes others' zones
- Awkward position: enforces law it hasn't joined

### Implications
- Less standing in disputes
- Can't use ITLOS
- Diplomatic disadvantage
- Bipartisan support for ratification (stalled)

## Challenges to UNCLOS

### China's Rejection
- 2016 arbitration ruling against China
- Beijing declared ruling "null and void"
- Continued South China Sea claims
- Built artificial islands
- Undermines dispute resolution

### Excessive Claims
Various states claim more than UNCLOS allows:
- Straight baselines (China)
- Historic waters (China, Libya)
- Security zones beyond territorial sea
- EEZ restrictions on military activities

### Enforcement Gap
- No UNCLOS navy
- Relies on state compliance
- Great powers can ignore
- Small states vulnerable

## 2026 Relevance

Multiple challenges to UNCLOS-based order:
- **South China Sea**: China ignoring tribunal ruling
- **Red Sea**: Houthi attacks on shipping
- **Taiwan Strait**: Disputed status (international strait vs. internal waters)
- **Arctic**: New routes, competing claims
