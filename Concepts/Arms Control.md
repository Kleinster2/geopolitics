# Arms Control

## Overview
Agreements between states to limit, reduce, or regulate weapons and military capabilities. A cornerstone of Cold War stability now unraveling as great power competition intensifies. The collapse of arms control frameworks is one symptom of the broader erosion of the liberal international order.

## Purpose

### Why Arms Control?
- **Reduce war risk**: Limit destabilizing weapons
- **Save money**: Avoid arms races
- **Build trust**: Transparency and verification
- **Manage competition**: Rules for rivalry
- **Prevent proliferation**: Limit spread of weapons

### The Paradox
States arm to be secure, but:
- Arms races can increase insecurity
- Mutual restraint can enhance security
- Cooperation in competition

## Major Agreements

### Nuclear Arms Control

| Treaty | Parties | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **NPT** (1968) | 191 states | In force, under strain |
| **START I** (1991) | US-Russia | Expired 2009 |
| **New START** (2010) | US-Russia | Suspended by Russia (2023) |
| **INF Treaty** (1987) | US-Russia | **Collapsed 2019** |
| **ABM Treaty** (1972) | US-Russia | **US withdrew 2002** |
| **CTBT** (1996) | 187 states | Never entered force |
| **Open Skies** (2002) | 34 states | **US withdrew 2020** |

### Conventional Arms Control

| Agreement | Scope | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **CFE Treaty** (1990) | European conventional forces | Russia suspended (2007) |
| **Ottawa Treaty** (1997) | Landmines ban | US, Russia, China not party |
| **CCM** (2008) | Cluster munitions | US, Russia not party |
| **ATT** (2014) | Arms trade | Weak enforcement |

### Chemical/Biological

| Treaty | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **CWC** (1997) | In force, violations (Syria, Russia) |
| **BWC** (1975) | In force, no verification |

## The Unraveling

### Hal Brands (January 2026)
> "International law and arms control agreements are unraveling as strategic rivalry intensifies."

### Key Collapses

**INF Treaty (2019)**
- Banned intermediate-range missiles in Europe
- US accused Russia of violations
- US withdrew
- Now both deploying missiles

**New START Suspension (2023)**
- Last US-Russia nuclear treaty
- Russia "suspended" participation
- No inspections since COVID
- Expires 2026 with no replacement

**Open Skies (2020)**
- Aerial observation flights
- Transparency measure
- US withdrew, Russia followed
- Europe left exposed

### Why Collapse?

1. **Great power competition returns**
   - Cooperation harder when rivals
   - Trust erodes
   - Cheating incentives rise

2. **Technology changes**
   - Hypersonics not covered
   - Cyber weapons undefined
   - AI/autonomous systems
   - Space weapons

3. **China not included**
   - Bilateral US-Russia framework
   - China rising but unconstrained
   - Trilateral talks failed

4. **Verification challenges**
   - New weapons harder to count
   - Dual-use technology
   - Inspections politically difficult

## Implications of Collapse

### Nuclear Risks
- No limits on arsenals
- Modernization unconstrained
- New weapons deployed
- Arms race dynamics
- Crisis stability reduced

### Conventional Risks
- European security degraded
- CFE collapse = force buildups
- Less predictability
- Accident/miscalculation risk

### Proliferation Risks
- NPT under strain
- Iran, North Korea examples
- Nuclear latency spreading
- Verification weakened

## The Future

### Pessimistic View
- Arms control era ending
- Return to pre-WWI dynamics
- Great powers unconstrained
- Technology outpaces diplomacy

### Optimistic View
- New frameworks possible
- Include China
- Address new technologies
- Crisis drives cooperation

### Current Reality
- Little momentum for new agreements
- Existing treaties dying
- Competition prioritized
- Risk management neglected
