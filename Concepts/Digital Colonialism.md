# Digital Colonialism

## Definition

The extension of imperial power relations through control of digital infrastructure, platforms, and data. [[Michael Kwet]] (University of Johannesburg / Yale ISP) developed the framework in his 2019 article in *Race & Class*, arguing that US tech corporations exercise imperial control at the architecture level.

## Kwet's Five Forms of Domination

1. **Monopoly extraction** - Concentrated corporate control over digital markets
2. **Control of computer-mediated experience** - Platforms determine what users see and do
3. **Surveillance capitalism** - Behavioral data extracted from populations (see [[Surveillance Capitalism]])
4. **Imperial state surveillance** - NSA/Five Eyes infrastructure enables mass surveillance
5. **Tech hegemony** - Standards and protocols embed particular political values

## Mechanisms

### Infrastructure Dependency
- Cloud computing: Global South data processed on US-controlled servers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Submarine cables: Ownership concentrated in US/European/Chinese hands
- Satellite internet: Starlink expanding without local governance framework
- Mobile networks: Equipment from Huawei (China) or Ericsson/Nokia (Europe) - either way, foreign

### Platform Dominance
- Operating systems: Android/iOS duopoly
- Search: Google dominant globally
- Social media: Meta platforms, TikTok
- E-commerce: Amazon expanding into Global South
- Content moderation: Rules set in Silicon Valley, applied globally

### Data Extraction
- Training data for AI harvested from Global South populations
- Behavioral data flows north/west
- Limited local data governance capacity
- "Data is the new oil" - and it flows the same direction

### Standards Setting
- Internet protocols designed in US/European institutions
- Technical standards embed assumptions about governance
- Participation in standards bodies requires resources many countries lack

## Case Study: Africa

### Current State
- 223 data centers across 38 African countries
- Projected $9.15B market by 2029
- Tension between foreign hyperscaler investment and local sovereignty
- Most data on African users stored outside the continent

### Responses
- **African Union Digital Transformation Strategy** (2020-2030)
- **AU AI Strategy** (2024)
- National data center initiatives
- Smart Africa Alliance

### The Sovereignty Trap (New America, 2025)
Building national data centers doesn't guarantee sovereignty if:
- The software is still foreign
- The expertise is still imported
- The standards are still set elsewhere
- The value extraction continues through different channels

## Counter-Proposals

### Kwet: People's Technology for People's Power
- Open-source infrastructure
- Community-owned networks
- Democratic data governance
- South-South technology cooperation

### India's Model
- Public digital infrastructure: Aadhaar, UPI, Open Network for Digital Commerce
- State-built alternatives to foreign platform dependency
- "Digital public goods" framework
- But: surveillance concerns remain

### China's Offer
- Digital Silk Road: Infrastructure at lower cost
- But: replaces one dependency with another
- Censorship technology exports
- Debt concerns

## Critiques of the Framework

- Overstates coherence of "US tech empire" - firms compete with each other
- Understates Global South agency - states and populations make strategic choices
- "Colonialism" analogy may obscure more than it reveals - no territorial occupation
- Not clear that alternatives (Chinese infrastructure, state control) improve outcomes for citizens

## Key Thinkers
- [[Michael Kwet]] - Primary framework developer
- Sareeta Amrute - Technology and race
- Payal Arora - "The Next Billion Users" - challenges Silicon Valley assumptions
- Nick Couldry & Ulises Mejias - "Data colonialism" (2019)
