# Dollar Dominance

## Overview
The US dollar's role as the world's primary reserve currency, trade invoicing unit, and financial system backbone. Gives the United States extraordinary economic leverage ("exorbitant privilege") and the ability to weaponize finance through sanctions.

## Dollar's Global Role

### Reserve Currency
- ~60% of global foreign exchange reserves
- Central banks hold dollars for stability
- Down from 70%+ but still dominant

### Trade Invoicing
- ~40% of global trade invoiced in dollars
- Oil priced in dollars ("petrodollar")
- Commodities generally dollar-denominated

### Financial Transactions
- Most international banking in dollars
- SWIFT messages predominantly dollar
- Dollar clearing through US banks

### Safe Haven
- Flight to dollar in crises
- US Treasury bonds = "risk-free" asset
- Global demand for dollar assets

## Why the Dollar Dominates

### Historical
- Bretton Woods system (1944)
- Gold-dollar standard until 1971
- US economic dominance post-WWII
- Network effects locked in

### Structural
- Deep, liquid US financial markets
- Rule of law, property rights
- Federal Reserve as backstop
- No viable alternative (yet)

### Self-Reinforcing
```
More trade in dollars
        ↓
More reserves held in dollars
        ↓
More dollar liquidity/markets
        ↓
More attractive for trade
        ↓
(cycle continues)
```

## Exorbitant Privilege

### Benefits to US
1. **Borrow cheaply**: Global demand for Treasuries
2. **Print to pay**: Debts in own currency
3. **Seigniorage**: Profit from currency issuance
4. **Sanctions power**: Can exclude from dollar system
5. **Financial intelligence**: Visibility into transactions

### Estimates
- Worth 0.5-1% GDP annually
- Lower interest rates
- Trade deficit financing
- Crisis resilience

## Dollar as Weapon

### Mechanisms

#### Primary Sanctions
- Block US persons from transactions
- Freeze assets in US jurisdiction
- Ban dollar transactions

#### Secondary Sanctions
- Punish non-US entities
- "Deal with them or deal with us"
- Extraterritorial reach
- Most controversial

#### SWIFT Access
- Belgium-based but US influence
- Exclusion = financial isolation
- Iran (2012, 2018), Russia (2022)

### Case Studies

| Target | Actions | Impact |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Iran | SWIFT exclusion, oil sanctions | Economic devastation |
| Russia | SWIFT (partial), reserves freeze | Significant but adapted |
| North Korea | Total isolation | Severe but regime survives |
| Venezuela | Oil sector, officials | Economic collapse |

## De-Dollarization Efforts

### Why States Want Alternatives
- Sanction vulnerability
- US policy dependence
- Political leverage concerns
- Monetary sovereignty

### Efforts Underway

#### China
- Yuan internationalization
- CIPS (alternative to SWIFT)
- Bilateral currency swaps
- Digital Yuan (e-CNY)
- Oil purchases in Yuan

#### Russia
- Ruble for gas (demanded)
- Yuan trade settlement
- Gold accumulation
- SPFS (domestic SWIFT)

#### BRICS
- Common currency discussions
- Local currency trade
- New Development Bank

#### Others
- Euro as alternative
- Cryptocurrency interest
- Gold purchases

### Progress Assessment

| Alternative | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Yuan | ~2-3% reserves, limited convertibility |
| Euro | ~20% reserves, no strategic intent |
| BRICS currency | Aspirational only |
| Crypto | Too volatile, regulatory issues |
| Gold | Reserve asset, not transaction medium |

## Limits of Dollar Dominance

### Structural Challenges
- US debt levels
- Political dysfunction
- Weaponization undermines trust
- Alternatives developing (slowly)

### Overuse Risk
> "If you weaponize the dollar too much, you incentivize alternatives"

Each sanction episode:
- Demonstrates power
- But motivates diversification

### Network Effects Protect
- Switching costs enormous
- No single alternative ready
- Fragmentation more likely than replacement

## Future Scenarios

### 1. Continued Dominance
- No alternative emerges
- Network effects persist
- US manages responsibly

### 2. Gradual Erosion
- Yuan grows slowly
- Regional blocs use own currencies
- Dollar remains largest but less dominant

### 3. Fragmentation
- Dollar zone vs. Yuan zone
- Regional currency blocs
- Less integrated global finance

### 4. Crisis Displacement
- US policy mistake
- Alternative emerges rapidly
- Historical precedent (UK to US)

## Geopolitical Implications

### US Leverage
- Unmatched economic coercion capability
- Sanctions as first resort
- Alliance value (protection)

### For Rivals
- Critical vulnerability
- Driving self-sufficiency efforts
- Long-term strategic priority

### For Allies
- Protected by dollar umbrella
- But also subject to US policy
- Secondary sanctions friction
