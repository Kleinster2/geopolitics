# Energy Security

## Definition
The uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price. Encompasses supply security, infrastructure protection, diversification, and increasingly, the geopolitics of energy transition.

## Key Dimensions

### Availability
- Sufficient supply to meet demand
- Reserve margins
- Production capacity
- Import access

### Affordability
- Price stability
- Economic sustainability
- Consumer impact
- Industrial competitiveness

### Reliability
- Infrastructure resilience
- Supply chain security
- Diversification
- Strategic reserves

### Sustainability
- Environmental impact
- Climate commitments
- Transition management
- Long-term viability

## Energy Types & Geopolitics

### Oil
- Most traded commodity
- OPEC influence
- Petrostates dependence
- Strategic petroleum reserves
- Price volatility

### Natural Gas
- Regional markets (LNG changing)
- Pipeline politics
- Russia leverage (Europe)
- LNG flexibility
- Growing demand

### Coal
- Declining in West
- Asian demand persistent
- Climate pressure
- Energy security backstop
- Transition challenges

### Nuclear
- Baseload power
- Proliferation concerns
- Uranium supply chains
- Renaissance debates
- SMR potential

### Renewables
- Critical minerals dependence
- China supply chain dominance
- Grid integration
- Storage challenges
- Energy independence potential

## Geopolitical Flashpoints

### Russia-Europe Gas

- 2022 weaponization
- Diversification response
- LNG alternatives
- Price shocks

### Middle East Oil
- Strait of Hormuz (20% global oil)
- Gulf producers
- Iran tensions
- Houthi attacks (Red Sea)
- US presence

### South China Sea

- Production coordination
- Price influence
- Saudi leadership
- Russia cooperation (OPEC+)
- Market power

### Major Producers
| Country | Role |
|---------|------|
| Saudi Arabia | Swing producer |
| Russia | Gas/oil giant |

| Qatar | LNG leader |
| Australia | LNG/coal |

### Major Consumers
- China (#1 importer)
- Europe (gas dependent)
- Japan/Korea (import dependent)
- India (growing demand)

## Energy Transition Geopolitics

### Winners
- Critical mineral holders
- Technology leaders
- Renewable exporters
- Grid flexibility

### Losers
- Petrostates (stranded assets)
- Coal exporters
- Undiversified economies

### Critical Minerals
- Lithium (Chile, Australia)
- Cobalt (DRC)
- Rare earths (China dominance)
- Copper (Chile, Peru)
- Supply chain concentration

## Strategic Reserves
