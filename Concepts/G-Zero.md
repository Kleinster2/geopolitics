# G-Zero

## Overview
Concept coined by [[Ian Bremmer]] (~2011) describing a world without global leadership. Unlike the G7, G8, or G20, the "G-Zero" represents a power vacuum where no country or coalition is willing and able to provide international public goods or set global rules. The defining condition of the current [[International Order]] transition.

## Definition

> "We are now living in a G-Zero world, one in which no single country or bloc of countries has the political and economic leverage—or the will—to drive a truly international agenda."
> — Ian Bremmer

### What G-Zero Means
- **No global policeman**: US withdrawing from role
- **No alternative leader**: China unwilling/unable to replace
- **No effective coalitions**: G7/G20 lack consensus
- **Every nation for itself**: Self-interested foreign policies
- **Governance gaps**: Global problems without global solutions

## How We Got Here

### US Decline/Retreat
- Overextension fatigue (Iraq, Afghanistan)
- Domestic polarization
- "America First" movements
- Unwillingness to bear costs
- Relative economic decline

### China's Limitations
- Not seeking global leadership role
- Regional focus primary
- Alternative model, not universal offer
- Free-rider preference
- Authoritarian legitimacy limits

### Institutional Decay
- UN Security Council gridlock
- WTO paralysis
- Climate agreements non-binding
- International law eroding
- Norms not enforced

## G-Zero vs. Alternatives

| Concept | Leadership | Character |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Unipolarity | Single hegemon (US) | Rules set by dominant power |
| Bipolarity | Two superpowers | Cold War competition |
| Multipolarity | Several great powers | Managed competition |
| **G-Zero** | **None** | **Power vacuum, chaos** |

### Key Distinction
G-Zero is NOT multipolarity:
- Multipolarity implies several powers managing affairs
- G-Zero means NO power managing affairs
- Result is not balance but vacuum
- Crises go unaddressed

## Manifestations (2026)

### Governance Gaps
- AI development without international rules
- Climate commitments abandoned
- Pandemic response fragmented
- Financial system ungoverned
- Cyberspace anarchic

### Regional Conflicts
- Ukraine unresolved
- Middle East chaos
- South China Sea tensions
- Africa's forgotten wars
- No mediator, no enforcer

### Economic Disorder
- Trade wars normalized
- Currency manipulation
- Supply chain weaponization
- Technology bifurcation
- Sanctions proliferation

## Eurasia Group Top Risks 2026 Analysis

In [[Eurasia Group Top Risks 2026]], "Overpowered" (Risk #2) describes G-Zero acceleration:

> The world's most dangerous geopolitical risks are converging with no one in charge.

Key points:
- "Damage control" now primary mode of international relations
- Even wealthy democracies can't coordinate
- Global problems compound without solutions
- Institutions exist but don't function

## Consequences

### For International Relations
- Self-help intensifies
- Alliances transactional
- Norms erode
- Conflicts protracted
- Cooperation episodic, limited

### For Global Economy
- Protectionism rises
- Supply chains fragment
- Standards diverge
- Investment uncertain
- Beggar-thy-neighbor policies

### For Global Problems
- Climate action stalls
- Pandemics spread
- Migration unmanaged
- Technology ungoverned
- Arms control collapses

## Who Benefits?

### Winners in G-Zero
- **Regional powers**: Freedom to dominate neighborhoods
- **Spoilers**: Less accountability for bad behavior
- **Nationalists**: Vindication of "every nation for itself"
- **Autocrats**: No international pressure

### Losers in G-Zero
- **Small states**: No protector, no rules
- **Global commons**: No steward
- **Vulnerable populations**: No advocate
- **Long-term challenges**: No coordinator

## Is G-Zero Permanent?

### Bremmer's View
- Not stable equilibrium
- Eventually some order emerges
- But transition could be long
- And very costly

### Possible Exits
1. **US re-engagement**: New commitment to leadership
2. **China steps up**: Unlikely given preferences
3. **Concert of powers**: Managed multipolarity
4. **Catastrophe forces cooperation**: Crisis as catalyst
5. **Regional orders consolidate**: Fragmented stability

## Relationship to Other Concepts

### [[International Order]]
G-Zero is the transition phase as liberal order decays without replacement.

### [[Hegemony]]
G-Zero is the absence of hegemony, but also absence of alternatives.

### [[Multipolarity]]
G-Zero precedes or prevents stable multipolarity.

### [[Predatory Hegemony]]
Trump's approach may be accelerating G-Zero by destroying alliances.
