# Security Dilemma

## Definition
A situation where actions taken by a state to increase its own security cause other states to feel less secure, prompting countermeasures that leave everyone worse off. One state's defense is another's threat.

## Key Thinkers
- John Herz (coined term, 1950)
- Robert Jervis
- Charles Glaser

## Core Mechanism
```
State A feels insecure
    ↓
State A builds military/defenses
    ↓
State B perceives threat
    ↓
State B responds with own buildup
    ↓
State A feels even less secure
    ↓
Arms race / spiral of hostility
```

## Why It Happens
1. **Anarchy**: No world government to provide security
2. **Uncertainty**: Cannot know others' intentions
3. **Offense-defense ambiguity**: Hard to distinguish defensive from offensive capabilities
4. **Worst-case thinking**: Prudent to assume the worst

## Severity Factors (Jervis)

### Offense-Defense Balance
- **Offense-dominant** world: More severe dilemma
- **Defense-dominant** world: Less severe

### Offense-Defense Distinguishability
- **Indistinguishable**: Severe (all buildups look threatening)
- **Distinguishable**: Milder (can signal defensive intent)

## Historical Examples

### Pre-WWI
- Anglo-German naval race
- Alliance systems
- Mobilization spirals

### Cold War
- Nuclear arms race
- US-Soviet buildup
- Cuban Missile Crisis

### Contemporary
- US-China military competition
- India-Pakistan
- NATO-Russia tensions

## Mitigation Strategies

### Transparency
- Arms control verification
- Military exchanges
- Confidence-building measures

### Defensive Postures
- Clearly defensive deployments
- No first-use pledges
- Arms limitations

### Institutions
- Security regimes
- Communication channels
- Crisis management mechanisms

### Signaling
- Restraint
- Unilateral gestures
- Track II diplomacy

## Limitations of Concept
- Assumes states are security-seekers (not power-maximizers)
- Some states may be genuinely aggressive
- Difficult to distinguish spiral from deterrence situations
- Nuclear weapons complicate dynamics
