# Pax Americana

## Overview
The era of relative peace and stability under American hegemony, roughly 1945-present. Analogous to Pax Britannica (1815-1914) and Pax Romana. Built on US military dominance, alliance networks, and liberal institutions. Now in question as US commitment wavers and challengers rise.

## The Concept

### "American Peace"
- Latin for "American Peace"
- Period of reduced great power war
- US hegemony as stabilizing force
- Global public goods provision
- Liberal international order

### Historical Parallels
| Era | Hegemon | Duration | Basis |
|-----|---------|----------|-------|
| Pax Romana | Rome | 27 BCE - 180 CE | Legions, roads, law |
| Pax Britannica | Britain | 1815-1914 | Royal Navy, trade, gold standard |
| Pax Americana | United States | 1945-? | Military, dollar, institutions |

## Foundations

### Military Dominance
- Largest defense budget (equals next 10 combined)
- Global force projection
- Nuclear umbrella
- Forward presence (800+ bases)
- Alliance network

### Economic Leadership
- Dollar as reserve currency
- Largest economy (until China?)
- Trade system architect
- IMF, World Bank control
- Technology leadership

### Institutional Framework
- UN Security Council veto
- NATO leadership
- Bretton Woods system
- WTO (formerly GATT)
- Liberal rules embedded

### Ideological Appeal
- Democracy promotion
- Human rights norms
- Free market capitalism
- Soft power
- Cultural influence

## Achievements

### Great Power Peace
- No WWIII
- Nuclear war avoided
- Major power war rare
- Europe pacified
- Asia stabilized (mostly)

### [[State Death]] Decline
> "Between 1816 and 1945, a quarter of the world's states simply vanished from the map. Since 1945, state death has become vanishingly rare." — Hal Brands

### Economic Growth
- Global GDP explosion
- Trade expansion
- Poverty reduction
- Development spread
- Globalization

### Norm Establishment
- Territorial conquest delegitimized
- [[Freedom of Navigation]] guaranteed
- [[Arms Control]] frameworks
- Human rights regime
- Democratic expansion

## The Dark Side

### Hypocrisy
- Interventions (Guatemala, Chile, Iraq)
- Dictator support when convenient
- Rules for thee, not for me
- Selective enforcement

### Costs Borne by Others
- Cold War proxy wars
- Vietnam, Korea casualties
- Middle East instability
- Global South exploitation?

### Not Universal Peace
- Many regional wars continued
- Civil wars, insurgencies
- Colonial/decolonization violence
- Millions still died

## Pax Americana Under Strain

### Challenger Rise
- China's economic/military growth
- Russia's revisionism
- Regional powers asserting
- Multipolarity emerging

### Internal Doubts
- Trump 1.0: "America First"
- Cost-benefit questioning
- Overextension fatigue
- Domestic focus priority
- Populist skepticism

### Institutional Decay
- UN gridlocked
- WTO paralyzed
- [[Arms Control]] collapsing
- Alliance strains
- Norms eroding

## 2026: End of Pax Americana?

### Trump's Recalculation
Hal Brands:
> "Trump calculates that a more nakedly competitive world works to the benefit of its fiercest, most formidable player."

Rather than sustain the order, profit from its demise.

### Signs of Erosion
- US threatening allies (Greenland)
- [[Gunboat Diplomacy]] return (Venezuela)
- [[Spheres of Influence]] acceptance
- Rules-based rhetoric abandoned
- [[Melian Dialogue]] as ethos

### What Comes Next?
| Scenario | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| **Pax Americana 2.0** | Renewed US commitment, adapted order |
| **Pax Sinica** | Chinese-led order (unlikely soon) |
| **Concert of Powers** | Great power management, spheres |
| **Disorder** | No hegemon, no rules, conflict rises |

## The Debate

### Defenders Say
- Most peaceful era in history
- Prosperity unprecedented
- Worth the costs
- Alternative worse

### Critics Say
- American empire, not peace
- Built on violence
- Served US interests
- Time for something new

### Realists Say
- All hegemons decline
- Nothing lasts forever
- Prepare for transition
- Manage the decline
