# Compellence

## Overview
Using threats or limited force to compel an adversary to change behavior or take action. Contrast with [[Deterrence]], which prevents action. Compellence is generally harder than deterrence because it requires the adversary to visibly back down.

## Deterrence vs. Compellence

| | Deterrence | Compellence |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Prevent action | Force action |
| **Timing** | Before adversary acts | After adversary has acted (or to initiate change) |
| **Visibility** | Adversary does nothing (can be quiet) | Adversary must visibly comply (public capitulation) |
| **Difficulty** | Easier | Harder |

## Why Compellence Is Harder

### Face-Saving Problem
Compliance looks like surrender. Adversary must publicly back down, creating domestic political costs. Deterrence success is invisible—the adversary simply doesn't act.

### Continuous Pressure
Deterrence threat can be passive (capabilities exist). Compellence requires ongoing, escalating pressure until adversary complies. Each day of non-compliance challenges credibility.

### Unclear Endpoints
When is compliance sufficient? Adversary may partially comply, drag feet, or find workarounds. Deterrence is binary—they attack or don't.

## Schelling's Framework
[[Thomas Schelling]] (*Arms and Influence*, 1966) distinguished:
- **Deterrence**: "If you do X, I will hurt you"
- **Compellence**: "Unless you do Y, I will continue/start hurting you"

Compellence involves initiating action and maintaining it until demands are met. The threat must be credible and the demand achievable.

## Examples

### Successful
- US compellence of Japan (atomic bombs → surrender)
- Cuban Missile Crisis (blockade → Soviet withdrawal)
- First Gulf War (coalition → Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait)

### Failed/Partial
- US maximum pressure on Iran (sanctions → no nuclear deal, no regime change)
- Russia compellence of Ukraine (invasion failed to achieve quick capitulation)
- Sanctions rarely achieve compellence goals

## Contemporary Relevance

### Ukraine
Russia attempted compellence—force Ukraine to accept territorial losses, neutrality. Failed because:
- Demands seen as unacceptable
- Western support sustained Ukrainian resistance
- Russia couldn't impose sufficient costs quickly

### Economic Sanctions
Most sanctions are compellent (change behavior) rather than deterrent. Track record is poor—compellence through economic pressure rarely works against resolved adversaries.

### Gray Zone
Much gray zone activity is compellent—using pressure below war threshold to force adversary concessions. Difficulty: if pressure is too low, adversary endures it; if too high, it becomes war.
