# Deglobalization

## Definition
The partial reversal or fragmentation of post-1990 economic globalization. Characterized by rising trade barriers, supply chain restructuring, reshoring/nearshoring, and the prioritization of security and resilience over efficiency.

Not a complete unwinding of global trade, but a shift from hyper-integrated global supply chains toward more regionalized, security-conscious economic arrangements.

## Key Drivers

### Geopolitical
- US-China strategic competition
- Russia-West rupture (2022)
- Rising nationalism and protectionism
- Sanctions as economic weapon
- "Friend-shoring" and bloc formation

### Economic
- COVID-19 supply chain disruptions
- Concentration risk awareness
- Inflation/cost pressures
- Labor and environmental standards

### Technological
- Automation reduces labor cost advantage
- Digital enables distributed production
- AI/chips as strategic assets

## Zeihan's Framework

[[Peter Zeihan]] argues deglobalization is **structural and inevitable**:

**His thesis:**
- Post-1945 globalization was a US strategic choice to build anti-Soviet alliance
- US paid for the system (open markets, naval protection) in exchange for alliance loyalty
- System was always temporary—US has declining interest in maintaining it
- Demographic aging worldwide reduces consumer base for export-led growth
- US has "other options" (energy independence, agricultural self-sufficiency, favorable geography)

**Prediction:** Return to regional blocs, more conflict, supply chain disruption. "Not a transition but a rupture."

## Manifestations (2025-2026)

### Trade Policy
- **Tariffs**: WTO reports global merchandise trade subject to tariffs reached $2.7 trillion (3x previous period)—highest since monitoring began 2009
- **US-China trade**: Down 30% in 2025 in sensitive sectors
- **Industrial policy**: US (CHIPS Act, IRA), EU (Green Deal Industrial Plan), China (Made in China 2025)

### Supply Chain Restructuring

| Strategy | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Reshoring** | Bring production home | GE: $3B to move appliances from China/Mexico to US |
| **Nearshoring** | Move to nearby countries | US companies → Mexico |
| **Friend-shoring** | Source from allies only | Chip supply chains excluding China |
| **China+1** | Diversify away from China | Vietnam, India as alternatives |

### Corporate Moves
- **GE**: $3B investment relocating production to southeastern US
- **Samsung/LG**: Shifting appliance production to South Carolina, Tennessee
- **Pharma**: GSK, Eli Lilly, Novartis building US plants to avoid tariffs

## The Complexity

Simple "deglobalization" narrative is incomplete:

### What's Actually Happening
- **Connector economies** (Mexico, Vietnam) absorbing China trade—import Chinese intermediates, export finished goods to US/EU
- **Regionalization** more than deglobalization—trade shifting within blocs, not disappearing
- **Selective decoupling**—sensitive sectors (chips, defense) vs. consumer goods
- **Services globalization** continuing even as goods fragment

### Reglobalization?
Some argue we're seeing "reglobalization"—rewiring rather than unwinding:
- New trade corridors
- Regional integration (RCEP, USMCA renegotiation)
- Digital trade growth

## Economic Impact

### Growth Slowdown
- Morgan Stanley: Global growth 2.9% in 2025 (down from 3.3% in 2024)
- OECD: 2.9% projected for 2025-2026
- Slowest since COVID

### Winners and Losers

**Potential Winners:**
- Mexico, Vietnam, India (connector economies)
- Countries with domestic capacity
- Automation/robotics firms

**Potential Losers:**
- Export-dependent economies (Germany, China, South Korea)
- Small open economies
- Consumers (higher prices)

## Debates

### Is It Real?
- **Yes**: Trade fragmentation, tariff surge, reshoring investment
- **Qualified**: Trade rewiring, not disappearing; services still globalizing

### Is It Good?
- **Security hawks**: Reduces vulnerability to adversaries
- **Economists**: Efficiency losses, inflation, slower growth
- **Environmentalists**: Mixed (shorter supply chains vs. lost scale)

### How Far Will It Go?
- **Maximalists** (Zeihan): Complete system breakdown within decade
- **Moderates**: Partial fragmentation, regional blocs
- **Skeptics**: Temporary disruption, globalization will adapt
