# Democracy and Authoritarianism

## Overview
The fundamental divide in global governance between systems based on popular sovereignty, individual rights, and competitive elections versus those based on concentrated power, limited participation, and state control. This divide increasingly shapes international alignments, alliances, and competition.

## Definitions

### Democracy
Government by the people, characterized by:
- Free and fair elections
- Rule of law
- Individual rights
- Political pluralism
- Separation of powers
- Free press

### Authoritarianism
Concentrated political power, characterized by:
- Limited political competition
- Weak rule of law
- Restricted civil liberties
- State control of media
- Regime security priority

### Spectrum
```
Full Democracy → Flawed Democracy → Hybrid → Competitive Auth → Closed Auth
```

## The Global Divide

### Democratic Camp
- United States
- European Union
- Japan, South Korea, Australia
- India (world's largest democracy)
- Various middle powers

### Authoritarian Camp
- China
- Russia
- Iran
- North Korea
- Various others

### Hybrid/Gray Zone
- Turkey
- Hungary
- Many developing states
- Competitive authoritarians

## Democratic Recession

### Trends (2006-Present)
- 18th consecutive year of decline (Freedom House)
- More countries declining than improving
- Backsliding in established democracies
- Rise of illiberal leaders

### Causes
- Economic inequality
- Immigration tensions
- Social media disruption
- Populist movements
- Elite failures
- Pandemic pressures

### Examples of Backsliding
- Hungary (Orbán)
- Poland (PiS period)
- Turkey (Erdogan)
- Brazil (Bolsonaro period)
- Philippines (Duterte period)
- India (democratic erosion concerns)
- **United States** (Trump era - see below)

## US Democratic Erosion (2025-2026)

### Acemoglu's "Theory of Trump"
Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu (*Why Nations Fail*) argues all Trump administration actions share unified logic: **expanding executive power toward an imperial presidency**.

### Three-Pronged Strategy

#### 1. Breaking Norms
- DOJ targeting political enemies
- National Guard deployments under "crime emergency" pretext
- President involved in family businesses while in office
- Defying court orders (deportation case)
- Crypto dealings that would have been prosecuted previously

#### 2. Removing Legal Barriers
- Supreme Court: near-absolute immunity for presidents (July 2024)
- Limits on nationwide injunctions
- Authority to fire independent agency heads
- Cutting Congress out of: tariffs, troop deployments, oversight

#### 3. Expanding De Facto Power
- Appointing loyalists to head agencies
- Unqualified appointees = more loyal, more compliant
- Dismantling "administrative state" / "deep state"
- Conflicts with Federal Reserve

### Carl Schmitt Connection
Acemoglu links Trump's philosophy to **Carl Schmitt** (1888-1985):
- German jurist who rose during Weimar/Third Reich
- Contempt for liberal democracy, parliamentary rule
- Called for authoritarian "sovereign" power
- "States of exception" require ultimate decider
- Ideas adopted by right-wing thinkers when facing democratic constraints

### Foreign Policy as Domestic Power
- Tariffs give president power over supply chains
- Makes major companies (Apple, Walmart) subservient
- Foreign interventions (Venezuela) boost domestic authority
- "Much more about his domestic agenda than about foreign policy"

### Lasting Danger
- Changes may be permanent regardless of successor
- Both left and right tempted to expand executive when in power
- "Real danger" = fundamental transformation of American politics

## Authoritarian Resilience

### Why Predictions Failed
- "End of history" didn't arrive
- Authoritarian adaptation
- Economic performance (China)
- Repression technology
- External support networks

### Authoritarian Learning
- Co-opt rather than just repress
- Managed elections
- Economic legitimacy
- Nationalist mobilization
- Technology for control

### China Model
- Economic growth without political reform
- "Performance legitimacy"
- Sophisticated surveillance
- Social credit system
- Party adaptation

## Geopolitical Competition

### "Democracy vs. Autocracy" Framing
- Biden administration emphasis
- Summit for Democracy
- Values-based alliances
- Contested effectiveness

### Critique of Framing
- Oversimplifies reality
- Alienates non-democracies
- Ignores democratic failings
- Pragmatism vs. ideology

### Authoritarian Cooperation
- Russia-China alignment
- Mutual support at UN
- Technology sharing
- Anti-Western solidarity
- Not formal alliance

## Democratic Foreign Policy

### Strengths
- Soft power, attraction
- Reliable alliances (shared values)
- Economic dynamism
- Innovation advantage

### Weaknesses
- Slow decision-making
- Public opinion constraints
- Electoral cycles
- Hypocrisy charges
- Polarization

### Democratic Peace Theory
- Democracies rarely fight each other
- Shared norms, transparency
- But: requires mature democracies
- And: democracies do fight non-democracies

## Authoritarian Foreign Policy

### Strengths
- Fast decision-making
- Long-term planning
- Ignore public opinion
- Risk tolerance

### Weaknesses
- Information problems
- Poor feedback
- Succession crises
- Legitimacy deficits
- Unreliable partners

### Russia Example
- Putin's long tenure
- Information bubble
- Ukraine miscalculation
- Demonstrates limits

## Technology and Regime Type

### Authoritarian Tech
- Surveillance systems
- AI for control
- Internet censorship
- Social credit (China)
- Export of tools

### Democratic Concerns
- Platform regulation debates
- Disinformation vulnerability
- Privacy vs. security
- Tech company power

### "Splinternet"
- Internet fragmenting
- China's Great Firewall
- Russia's isolation
- Digital sovereignty
- See: [[Technology Competition]]

## Information Warfare

### Authoritarian Advantage
- Control domestic narrative
- Project externally
- Exploit democratic openness
- Disinformation campaigns

### Democratic Vulnerability
- Free press exploitable
- Social media manipulation
- Polarization amplified
- Trust erosion
- See: [[Information Warfare]]

## Alliance Patterns

### Democratic Alignments
- NATO
- Quad
- AUKUS
- G7
- Values-based framing

### Authoritarian Alignments
- Russia-China partnership
- Iran-Russia cooperation
- North Korea ties
- Not formal alliances (yet)

### Non-Aligned
- Many Global South states
- Pragmatic partnerships
- Reject binary framing
- Economic interests first

## Promoting Democracy

### Historical Approaches
- Democracy promotion programs
- Conditionality (aid, trade)
- Election monitoring
- Civil society support

### Current Debates
- Effectiveness questioned
- Backlash against "imposition"
- Sovereignty concerns
- Hypocrisy charges
- Selective application

### Limits of Promotion
- Can't export democracy
- Must be domestic-driven
- External support limited
- Authoritarian pushback

## Future Trajectories

### Questions
- Democratic renewal possible?
- Authoritarian sustainability?
- Technology's role?
- Global South trajectory?

### Scenarios
1. Democratic revival
2. Authoritarian consolidation
3. Hybrid dominant
4. Regional variation
