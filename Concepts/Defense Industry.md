# Defense Industry

## Overview
The industrial base that designs, develops, and produces military equipment. A strategic asset that determines military capability independence. The "military-industrial complex" shapes both economic and security policy.

## Strategic Importance

### Why It Matters
1. **Sovereignty**: Produce your own weapons vs. dependency
2. **Technology**: Defense drives innovation (internet, GPS, jet engines)
3. **Economics**: High-value jobs, exports, R&D
4. **Surge capacity**: Ability to ramp up in crisis
5. **Alliance value**: What you can contribute/sell

### Dependency Risks
- Supply chain vulnerabilities
- Political leverage by suppliers
- Technology access limitations
- Wartime production constraints

## Global Defense Industry Map

### United States
- **Size**: ~$400B+ industry
- **Champions**: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon (RTX), Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics
- **Characteristics**: Largest, most advanced, export leader
- **Issues**: Consolidation, workforce, cost overruns

### Europe
- **Champions**: BAE Systems (UK), Airbus Defence, Leonardo (Italy), Thales (France), Rheinmetall (Germany)
- **Characteristics**: Fragmented, consolidation efforts, capable but not scaled
- **Issues**: Duplication, national champions vs. integration

### Russia
- **Champions**: Rosoboronexport (export), United Aircraft, Almaz-Antey
- **Characteristics**: State-controlled, combat-proven, export competitive
- **Issues**: Ukraine war attrition, sanctions, technology gaps

### China
- **Champions**: AVIC, NORINCO, CASIC, CSIC (shipbuilding)
- **Characteristics**: Rapid modernization, massive scale, improving quality
- **Issues**: Engine technology, limited export success, IP concerns

### Other Significant
| Country | Strength | Champions |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Israel | Drones, EW, missiles | IAI, Elbit, Rafael |
| South Korea | Shipbuilding, armor, artillery | Hanwha, Hyundai, KAI |
| Turkey | Drones, armored vehicles | Baykar, ASELSAN |
| India | Aspirational, growing | HAL, BEL, DRDO |

- European consolidation ongoing

### Government Relationship
- Monopsony buyer (single customer)
- Cost-plus contracts
- Regulatory oversight
- Political influence

### Innovation Model
- Government-funded R&D
- Long development cycles
- Technology transition challenges
- Commercial tech integration
