# Nuclear Triad

## Overview
Three independent nuclear delivery systems - land-based ICBMs, submarine-launched SLBMs, and strategic bombers - designed to ensure survivable second-strike capability. The logic: no single attack can destroy all three legs, guaranteeing retaliation and thus deterrence.

## The Three Legs

| Leg | Systems | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Land** | ICBMs in silos | Fast response, accurate, reliable | Fixed targets, vulnerable to first strike |
| **Sea** | SLBMs on submarines | Most survivable, mobile, hidden | Communication challenges, slower response |
| **Air** | Strategic bombers | Recallable, flexible, visible signal | Slow, detectable, vulnerable on ground |

## Strategic Logic

### Survivability
No adversary can destroy all three legs simultaneously:
- Silos are hardened but locatable
- Submarines are hidden but limited in number
- Bombers can disperse but need warning time

At least one leg survives to retaliate → assured destruction → deterrence holds.

### Redundancy
Each leg compensates for others' weaknesses:
- ICBMs provide speed when submarines can't communicate
- Submarines survive when silos are destroyed
- Bombers offer flexibility and recall option

### Crisis Stability
Triad reduces "use it or lose it" pressure:
- Vulnerable forces tempt preemption
- Survivable forces allow waiting, verifying, deciding
- Reduces accidental war risk

## Who Has Full Triads

### United States
| Leg | System | Numbers |
|-----|--------|---------|
| Land | Minuteman III | 400 missiles |
| Sea | Ohio-class SSBNs | 14 submarines |
| Air | B-52H, B-2A, (B-21) | ~60 bombers |

### Russia
| Leg | System | Numbers |
|-----|--------|---------|
| Land | SS-18, SS-27, etc. | ~320 ICBMs |
| Sea | Delta/Borei SSBNs | ~10 submarines |
| Air | Tu-95, Tu-160 | ~60 bombers |

### China (Emerging)
| Leg | System | Status |
|-----|--------|--------|
| Land | DF-5, DF-31, DF-41 | Operational, expanding |
| Sea | Jin-class SSBNs | 6 operational, expanding |
| Air | H-6K/N, (H-20) | Limited nuclear role; H-20 in development |

China is building toward a full triad but air leg remains weakest.

## Incomplete Triads

### France (Dyad)
- **Sea**: 4 Triomphant-class SSBNs ✓
- **Air**: Rafale with ASMP-A missiles ✓
- **Land**: None ✗

### United Kingdom (Monad)
- **Sea**: 4 Vanguard-class SSBNs (Trident) ✓
- **Air**: None (retired WE.177 bombs 1998) ✗
- **Land**: None ✗

### India (Emerging Triad)
- All three legs but limited numbers and capabilities

### Others
- **Pakistan**: Land and air; sea leg developing
- **Israel**: Believed to have all three (undeclared)
- **North Korea**: Land-based focus; SLBM tested

## Why It Matters for Europe

Per Augusto Teixeira (UFPB, February 2026): The [[Northwood Declaration]] promises UK-France nuclear response to "extreme threats" to Europe. But:

| Combined UK+France | Russia |
|-------------------|--------|
| ~500 warheads | ~6,200 warheads |
| No land-based ICBMs | Full triad |
| Small SSBN fleets | Larger SSBN fleet |

**Credibility gap**: Russia could theoretically threaten to overwhelm European arsenals. US triad at scale is what makes extended deterrence credible - hence European anxiety when US commitment wavers.

## Triad Debates

### Keep All Three Legs?
**Arguments for:**
- Redundancy essential for deterrence
- Each leg deters different scenarios
- Modernization cheaper than replacement

**Arguments against:**
- Expensive to maintain three systems
- Submarines alone may suffice (UK model)
- Land leg increasingly vulnerable to precision strike

### US Modernization
All three legs being modernized simultaneously:
- Sentinel ICBM (replacing Minuteman)
- Columbia-class SSBN (replacing Ohio)
- B-21 Raider (supplementing B-2)

Cost: ~$1.5 trillion over 30 years
