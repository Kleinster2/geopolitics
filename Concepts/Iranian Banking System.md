# Iranian Banking System

## Overview
Iran's banking system is in systemic crisis as of January 2026. Cut off from the international financial system by sanctions, riddled with corruption and self-dealing by regime-connected elites, and now experiencing bank failures, the sector is a key vulnerability for the Islamic Republic. The collapse of Ayandeh Bank in late 2025 helped trigger the [[Iran Protests 2025-2026]].

## Structure

### Central Bank
- **Central Bank of Iran (CBI)** - Bank Markazi
- Governor: Abdolnasser Hemmati (appointed January 2026, replacing Mohammad Reza Farzin)
- Functions: Monetary policy, currency management, bank supervision
- Problem: Finances government deficits through money printing

### Bank Categories

| Type | Examples | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **State-owned** | [[Bank Melli Iran]], [[Bank Mellat]], [[Bank Saderat Iran]] | Largest, government-controlled |
| **Private** | [[Ayandeh Bank]], Parsian Bank | Often regime-connected |
| **Specialized** | Bank Maskan (housing), Bank Keshavarzi (agriculture) | Sector-specific |
| **IRGC-linked** | Various | Revolutionary Guards have stakes |

## The Crisis

### Ayandeh Bank Collapse (Late 2025)

**Key Facts:**
- **Losses**: ~$5 billion from bad loans
- **Cause**: Massive self-lending scheme
- **CBI assessment**: "A Ponzi scheme"
- **Management**: Regime-affiliated individuals
- **Trigger**: Helped spark December 2025 protests

**How It Worked:**
1. Bank made loans to companies owned by bank insiders
2. Companies couldn't/didn't repay
3. Losses mounted, hidden from regulators
4. Eventually became unsustainable
5. Collapse exposed when depositors couldn't withdraw

### Other Vulnerable Banks
**Five other Iranian banks** reportedly in similarly fragile condition (sources: Israeli media, Western analysts). Names not publicly confirmed, but pattern of self-dealing believed widespread.

### Systemic Problems

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Self-lending** | Insiders lend to themselves/cronies |
| **NPLs** | High non-performing loan ratios |
| **IRGC extraction** | Revolutionary Guards use banks for financing |
| **Sanctions** | Cannot access international markets |
| **Currency mismatch** | Assets in collapsing rial |
| **Deposit flight** | Iranians moving money out |
| **Money printing** | CBI monetizing deficits |

## IRGC and Banking

The [[IRGC]] has deep involvement in Iran's financial sector:

- **Direct ownership**: Stakes in banks and financial institutions
- **Loan access**: Preferential lending to IRGC-linked companies
- **Sanctions evasion**: Banks used to move money around sanctions
- **Corruption**: Self-dealing, no accountability
- **Crowding out**: Private sector cannot compete

This creates a system where:
- Banks serve regime interests, not economic efficiency
- Losses are socialized, profits privatized
- No real supervision or accountability
- Political connections matter more than creditworthiness

## Sanctions Impact

### SWIFT Cutoff
Iranian banks largely cut off from SWIFT (international payment messaging system):
- Cannot process international transfers normally
- Must use workarounds (front companies, intermediaries)
- Increases transaction costs
- Slows trade

### Correspondent Banking
- Major international banks won't touch Iranian transactions
- Even permitted trade is difficult
- Letters of credit hard to obtain
- Trade finance collapsed

### Asset Freezes
- Iranian bank assets frozen in many jurisdictions
- CBI assets targeted
- Limits ability to intervene in currency markets

## Currency Connection

Banks and currency crisis are intertwined:

1. **Rial collapse** (84% in 2025) destroys bank balance sheets
2. **Deposit flight** as Iranians convert to dollars/gold
3. **Capital flight** ($10-20B in 2025) drains banking system
4. **Money printing** to cover losses accelerates inflation
5. **Inflation** further erodes deposits → more flight

This creates a **doom loop** that's difficult to escape.

## Comparison to Historical Crises

| Crisis | Similarity | Difference |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **2008 US** | Bad loans, systemic risk | Iran can't bail out, no intl access |
| **1997 Asian** | Currency + banking combined | Iran more isolated |
| **Venezuela** | Sanctions, mismanagement | Iran larger, more complex |
| **Lebanon 2019** | Ponzi-like banking, political capture | Iran has oil (if it could sell) |

## Government Response

### What They've Done
- Appointed new CBI governor (Hemmati)
- Attempted to reassure depositors
- Food coupon system to offset inflation

### What They Can't Do
- **Recapitalize banks**: No money, no international access
- **Let banks fail**: Would trigger runs on others
- **Stop printing**: Would collapse government
- **Attract foreign capital**: Sanctions + instability

## Implications

### For Regime Stability
- Bank failures directly triggered protests
- Middle class savings wiped out
- Bazaaris (merchants) dependent on banking
- Loss of economic legitimacy

### For Sanctions Policy
- Banking sanctions among most effective
- Demonstrate limits of autarky
- But also humanitarian concerns (ordinary Iranians suffer)

### For Regional Actors
- Hezbollah, other proxies affected by Iranian financial weakness
- Iran cannot fund proxies as generously
- Potential for instability spillover

## Prognosis

**Assessment**: Iranian banking system is insolvent by normal standards. Only survives through:
- Government backing (itself broke)
- Closed capital account (partially)
- Repression of alternatives
- Lack of transparency

**Trajectory**: Without sanctions relief or massive external support (unlikely), continued deterioration. More bank failures possible. Depositors increasingly desperate.
