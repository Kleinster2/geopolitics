# Migration

## Overview
The movement of people across borders, both voluntary (economic) and forced (refugees). A major driver of domestic politics, international relations, and demographic change. Increasingly securitized and politicized globally.

## Types of Migration

### By Motivation

| Type | Driver | Legal Status |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Economic | Jobs, opportunity | Often irregular |
| Family | Reunification | Usually legal |
| Refugee | Persecution (1951 Convention) | Protected status |
| Asylum seeker | Fleeing harm, pending status | Protected during process |
| Climate | Environmental displacement | No legal category |
| Conflict | War, violence | Often refugees |

### By Pattern
- **Temporary**: Seasonal, guest workers
- **Permanent**: Settlement
- **Circular**: Back and forth
- **Transit**: Through countries
- **Internal**: Within country (displaced persons)

## Scale of Migration

### Global Numbers (2024)
- **International migrants**: ~280 million (3.6% of global population)
- **Refugees**: ~35 million (UNHCR mandate)
- **Internally displaced**: ~70 million
- **Asylum seekers**: ~5 million pending

### Trends
- Increasing overall
- More displacement (conflict, climate)
- Diversifying destinations
- Mixed flows (economic + forced)

## Why Migration is Geopolitical

### For Receiving Countries
- Labor force (aging societies)
- Cultural/social impacts
- Political polarization
- Security concerns
- Integration challenges

### For Sending Countries
- Remittances (lifeline)
- Brain drain
- Diaspora influence
- Population pressure relief
- Political safety valve

### Between Countries
- Leverage tool
- Cooperation issue
- Burden-sharing disputes
- Border tensions

## Major Migration Flows

### Global Hotspots

| Flow | Source → Destination | Numbers |
|------|---------------------|---------|
| Latin America → US | Central America, Mexico, Venezuela | 2M+ annually (irregular) |
| Africa → Europe | Sahel, Horn, North Africa | 100-200K annually |
| Middle East → Europe | Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq | Peaked 2015-16 |
| South Asia → Gulf | India, Pakistan, Bangladesh | Millions (guest workers) |
| Venezuela exodus | → Colombia, region | 7M+ displaced |
| Ukraine refugees | → Europe | 6M+ (2022) |
| Myanmar | → Bangladesh, Thailand | 1M+ Rohingya |

## Migration as Weapon

### "Weaponized Migration"

#### Concept
States deliberately facilitate or threaten migration flows to coerce others.

#### Examples
| Actor | Action | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Turkey | Threatened to "open gates" | EU |
| Belarus | Facilitated flow at Polish border | EU/Poland |
| Morocco | Allowed crossing to Ceuta | Spain |
| Libya | Controls departure point | EU leverage |

#### EU-Turkey Deal (2016)
- €6B to Turkey
- Keep refugees in Turkey
- Criticized: Outsourcing, leverage created

### Instrumentalization
- Authoritarian origin countries
- Transit countries as gatekeepers
- Democratic vulnerability exploited

## European Migration Politics

### 2015 Crisis
- 1M+ arrivals (Syria, Afghanistan, etc.)
- "Wir schaffen das" (Merkel)
- Political backlash → rise of far-right
- EU unity strained

### Current System
- External border focus (Frontex)
- Deals with origin/transit states
- Dublin system (broken)
- Redistribution disputes
- Mediterranean deaths

### Political Impact
- AfD (Germany)
- National Rally (France)
- Vox (Spain)
- Brexit (partial driver)
- EU cohesion challenge

## US Migration Politics

### Southern Border
- Central America "Northern Triangle"
- Mexican cartels
- Border infrastructure (wall debates)
- Title 42 / Remain in Mexico
- Political polarization extreme

### Drivers
- Violence (gangs, cartels)
- Economic opportunity
- Climate (drought)
- Governance failures
- US demand for labor

### Policy Oscillation
- Obama: DACA, enforcement
- Trump: Family separation, wall
- Biden: Reversal attempts, surges

## Refugee System

### 1951 Convention
- Persecution definition
- Non-refoulement (can't return)
- Rights framework
- Never designed for current scale

### UNHCR
- 35M+ refugees under mandate
- Camps, resettlement
- Underfunded
- Host country dependence

### Major Host Countries
1. Turkey (3.6M)
2. Iran (3.4M)
3. Colombia (2.5M)
4. Germany (2.1M)
5. Pakistan (1.7M)

### Global North vs. South
- 70%+ of refugees in developing countries
- Neighboring countries bear burden
- Resettlement limited (<1%)
- Inequity in system

## Climate Migration

### Scale
- 200M+ climate migrants by 2050 (estimates)
- Mostly internal
- Cross-border increasing
- No legal framework

### Drivers
- Sea level rise (Bangladesh, Pacific)
- Desertification (Sahel)
- Drought (Central America)
- Extreme weather

### Legal Gap
- Not "refugees" under 1951 Convention
- No protected status
- Advocacy for expansion
- Political resistance

## Demographics and Migration

### Aging Societies Need Migrants
- Europe, Japan, Korea
- Labor force shrinkage
- Pension sustainability
- Care economy

### But Political Resistance
- Cultural concerns
- Integration challenges
- Competition fears
- Identity politics

### Demographic Dividend
- Young populations (Africa)
- Emigration pressure
- Brain drain concerns
- Remittance dependence

## Remittances

### Scale
- $650B+ annually
- Exceeds foreign aid
- Critical for many economies

### Top Recipients (absolute)
1. India ($100B+)
2. Mexico ($60B)
3. China ($50B)
4. Philippines ($35B)
5. Pakistan ($30B)

### Geopolitical Dimension
- Dependence creates leverage
- Diaspora as influence channel
- Financial flows = soft power

## Migration Governance

### International Frameworks
- 1951 Refugee Convention
- Global Compact on Migration (2018)
- Global Compact on Refugees (2018)
- IOM (International Organization for Migration)

### Gaps
- No binding migration framework
- Climate migrants unprotected
- Enforcement weak
- Sovereignty trumps cooperation
