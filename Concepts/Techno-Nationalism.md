# Techno-Nationalism

## Definition

The fusion of technology policy with nationalist ideology - the belief that technological capabilities are central to national security and power, and that states must ensure domestic control over critical technologies. Manifests as industrial policy, export controls, forced technology transfer restrictions, and the creation of technology blocs along geopolitical lines.

## Distinction from Technology Competition

All states compete technologically. Techno-nationalism is specifically the framing of this competition in nationalist/security terms rather than purely economic ones, leading to policies that prioritize control over efficiency.

A 2024 article in *Science and Public Policy* (Oxford) distinguishes techno-nationalism from "collaborative technology sovereignty" - the former seeking autarky, the latter seeking independence through alliances.

## Manifestations

### United States
- **CHIPS Act** (2022): $52B to reshore semiconductor manufacturing
- **Export controls** (2022-2025): Denying China advanced chips and equipment
- **CFIUS**: Blocking foreign acquisitions of tech firms
- **TikTok ban debate**: National security framing of platform competition
- **"Pax Silica" alliance** (December 2025): Netherlands joined US-led semiconductor control coalition
- **AI Diffusion Rule** (2025, later rescinded): Tiered global chip access

### China
- **Made in China 2025**: Technology self-sufficiency targets
- **$150B+ semiconductor investment**: National champion strategy
- **Dual circulation**: Reducing external dependency
- **Digital Silk Road**: Exporting Chinese tech standards/infrastructure
- **Great Firewall**: Protecting domestic platform market

### European Union
- **Digital sovereignty** framing: Technology independence from US and China
- **GDPR/AI Act/DSA**: Regulatory power as substitute for market dominance
- **France-Germany Digital Sovereignty Summit** (November 2025)
- **European Chips Act**: Targeting 20% global production by 2030

### India
- **Atmanirbhar Bharat** (Self-Reliant India): Domestic manufacturing push
- **App bans**: 200+ Chinese apps banned since 2020
- **Public digital infrastructure**: Aadhaar, UPI as alternatives to foreign platforms
- **PLI schemes**: Production-linked incentives for electronics

## The Techno-Bloc Structure (2025)

Per *International Organization* (Cambridge, 2025), technology alignment is creating new geopolitical groupings:

| Bloc | Members | Strategy |
|------|---------|----------|
| US-led | US, Japan, Netherlands, Korea, Taiwan | Export controls, allied supply chains |
| EU | EU-27 | Regulatory sovereignty, strategic autonomy |
| China-led | China, Russia (partial) | Self-sufficiency, alternative standards |
| Non-aligned | India, Global South | Hedging, bilateral deals, public infrastructure |

## Risks

### Economic Costs
- Duplicated investment (every bloc building its own fabs)
- Lost efficiency from fragmented supply chains
- Innovation slowdown from reduced knowledge flows
- Consumers pay more

### Strategic Risks
- Unrealistic autarky goals - no state can do everything
- Accelerates adversary self-sufficiency (China responds to controls with crash programs)
- Ally management problems (forcing choices damages relationships)
- "Friendly-shoring" still concentrates risk

### Escalation Dynamics
- Technology denial invites retaliation
- Unclear where "security" ends and protectionism begins
- Arms race logic applied to civilian technology

## Critiques

- True technological autarky is impossible for any state - supply chains are too complex
- Conflates economic competitiveness with national security
- Risk of "security washing" ordinary protectionism
- May harm the innovators it claims to protect (restricting markets, talent flows)
- Semiconductor controls may accelerate Chinese independence rather than prevent it
