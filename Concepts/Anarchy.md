# Anarchy (International System)

## Overview
The foundational condition of international politics: there is no world government above states. Unlike domestic politics with police and courts, states exist in a "self-help" system where they must provide for their own security. This shapes everything in geopolitics.

## Definition

### What Anarchy Means
- **No supreme authority** above states
- **No world police** to enforce rules
- **No world court** with compulsory jurisdiction
- States are **sovereign** equals (legally)
- Each state must **self-help** for survival

### What Anarchy Does NOT Mean
- Not chaos or disorder
- Not absence of cooperation
- Not constant warfare
- Not lawlessness

## Why Anarchy Matters

### The Ordering Principle
Domestic vs. International:

| Domestic | International |
|----------|---------------|
| Hierarchy (government above citizens) | Anarchy (no authority above states) |
| Specialization (police, courts, etc.) | Self-help (states do it all) |
| Rule of law enforced | Rules exist but no enforcer |
| Monopoly on violence | Distributed violence capability |

### Consequences of Anarchy

1. **Self-help**: States must ensure own survival
2. **Security uncertainty**: Can't trust others' intentions
3. **Power matters**: Capability determines outcomes
4. **Cooperation difficult**: No enforcer for agreements
5. **Survival priority**: Existential concerns dominate

## Theoretical Perspectives

### Realism: Anarchy is Determinative
- Anarchy forces competition
- States seek power/security
- Trust is dangerous
- Conflict is endemic
- International politics is tragic

### Liberalism: Anarchy Can Be Mitigated
- Institutions reduce uncertainty
- Repeated interaction builds trust
- Interdependence raises cooperation benefits
- Democracy changes state behavior
- Progress is possible

### Constructivism: "Anarchy is What States Make of It"
Alexander Wendt's famous argument:
- Anarchy has no inherent logic
- States create meaning through interaction
- Enemies or friends is socially constructed
- US-Canada vs. US-North Korea (same anarchy, different relationships)
- Culture and identity matter

## Security Dilemma

Anarchy's most important consequence:

```
State A feels insecure (anarchy)
    ↓
State A arms for defense
    ↓
State B sees threat (can't know intentions)
    ↓
State B arms in response
    ↓
State A feels more insecure
    ↓
Spiral continues
```

## Attempts to Escape Anarchy

### International Institutions
- United Nations
- WTO, IMF, World Bank
- Regional organizations
- Don't eliminate anarchy but mitigate it

### International Law
- Treaties, customs, norms
- No enforcement mechanism
- States comply when convenient
- "Law without government"

### Alliances
- Collective security
- Bandwagoning with strong
- Still within anarchy (can collapse)

### Hegemony
- One state provides order
- "World policeman"
- Still not true hierarchy
- See: [[Hegemony]]

## Anarchy and Cooperation

### Why Cooperation Happens Despite Anarchy
1. **Repeated games**: Future matters
2. **Reciprocity**: Tit-for-tat strategies
3. **Institutions**: Reduce transaction costs
4. **Interdependence**: Shared interests
5. **Norms**: Appropriate behavior

### Limits on Cooperation
- High stakes (survival) → self-help dominates
- Uncertainty about intentions persists
- Relative gains concerns
- Cheating temptation

## Historical Context

### Westphalian System (1648)
- Established sovereign state system
- No authority above states
- Religious wars → secular order
- Foundation of modern anarchy

### Pre-Westphalian
- Empires, church authority
- Hierarchical elements
- Different ordering principles

### Future?
- Erosion of sovereignty?
- Global governance growth?
- Still fundamentally anarchic

## Implications for Policy

### What States Must Do
- Maintain military capability
- Form alliances carefully
- Treat commitments cautiously
- Plan for self-reliance
- Watch power shifts

### What States Cannot Assume
- Others' good intentions
- Agreements will hold
- Institutions will protect
- Help will arrive
- Peace is permanent
