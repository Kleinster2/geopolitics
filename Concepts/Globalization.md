# Globalization

## Overview
The increasing interconnection of economies, societies, and political systems across national borders through trade, investment, migration, information flows, and cultural exchange. Accelerated dramatically post-Cold War but now facing pressures from nationalism, [[Great Power Competition]], and supply chain vulnerabilities. See [[Deglobalization]] for the counter-trend.

## Dimensions

### Economic
- Trade: Goods crossing borders (grew 25x since 1950)
- Investment: Foreign direct investment, capital flows
- Production: Global supply chains, offshoring
- Finance: Integrated capital markets, currency flows

### Technological
- Communications: Internet, social media
- Transportation: Containerization, air travel
- Information: Instantaneous global news, data

### Social/Cultural
- Migration: Labor mobility, diasporas
- Culture: Global media, shared consumption patterns
- Ideas: Diffusion of norms, ideologies

### Political
- International institutions: WTO, IMF, UN
- Governance networks: Standards, regulations
- Transnational issues: Climate, pandemic, terrorism

## Historical Waves

### First Globalization (1870-1914)
- Telegraph, steamship, railroads
- Gold standard, British hegemony
- Mass migration (60 million from Europe)
- Ended by WWI

### Interwar Retreat (1914-1945)
- Tariffs, protectionism
- Great Depression
- Autarky, imperial blocs
- WWII

### Bretton Woods Era (1945-1971)
- Managed globalization
- Fixed exchange rates
- Capital controls
- GATT trade liberalization

### Hyperglobalization (1980s-2008)
- Deregulation, liberalization
- China's opening (1978, WTO 2001)
- Containerization revolution
- Financial integration
- "End of history" optimism

### Crisis and Contestation (2008-present)
- Financial crisis (2008)
- Populist backlash
- Trump tariffs, Brexit
- COVID supply chain disruptions
- US-China decoupling

## Theoretical Perspectives

### Liberal View
- Mutual gains from trade
- Peace through interdependence
- Convergence toward prosperity
- Institutions enable cooperation

### Realist Critique
- Relative gains matter
- Interdependence creates vulnerability
- States use economic tools strategically
- [[Weaponized Interdependence]]

### Marxist/Critical View
- Uneven development
- Core-periphery exploitation
- Capital mobility vs. labor immobility
- Race to the bottom

### Nationalist/Populist View
- Job losses in developed countries
- Sovereignty erosion
- Cultural dilution
- Elite vs. working class divide

## Benefits

### Economic
- Lower consumer prices
- Specialization gains
- Technology diffusion
- Poverty reduction (China, Asia)

### Political
- Interdependence raises war costs
- Spread of norms (human rights, democracy)
- Problem-solving capacity (global issues)

### Social
- Cultural exchange
- Educational opportunities
- Diasporic connections

## Costs and Critiques

### Economic
- Manufacturing job losses (developed world)
- Inequality within countries
- Volatility, crisis contagion
- Race to bottom (labor, environment)

### Political
- Sovereignty constraints
- Democratic accountability gaps
- Regulatory arbitrage
- Dependence vulnerabilities

### Social
- Cultural homogenization fears
- Migration tensions
- Identity backlash
- Community disruption

## Current Pressures

### [[Deglobalization]] Drivers
- US-China decoupling
- Supply chain "resilience" focus
- Industrial policy revival
- Security concerns override efficiency

### But Also
- Digital globalization continues
- Services trade growing
- Some production shifting but not reversing
- Regionalization more than de-globalization

## Measurement
- Trade/GDP ratios
- FDI flows
- Migration stocks
- Financial integration indices
- KOF Globalization Index
