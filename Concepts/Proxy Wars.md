# Proxy Wars

## Definition
Conflicts where major powers support opposing sides (with money, weapons, training, or troops) rather than fighting each other directly. Allows competition while avoiding direct confrontation and escalation risks.

## Key Characteristics
1. **Indirect confrontation**: Major powers avoid direct clash
2. **Local actors**: Fight with external support
3. **Plausible deniability**: Can disavow involvement
4. **Limited escalation**: Reduces great power war risk
5. **Prolonged conflicts**: External support sustains fighting

## Why States Use Proxies

### For Great Powers
- Avoid direct war costs/casualties
- Test adversary without escalation
- Maintain plausible deniability
- Advance interests cheaply
- Bleed adversary resources

### For Proxies
- Gain resources/weapons
- Advance own agenda
- International backing
- Survivability
- Legitimacy

## Types of Proxies

### State Proxies
- Client states fighting on behalf of patron
- Example: North Vietnam (Soviet/Chinese support)

### Non-State Proxies
- Militias, insurgents, terrorist groups
- Example: Iran's "Axis of Resistance"

### Private Military Companies
- Wagner Group (Russia)
- Historical: Executive Outcomes

## Cold War Examples

| Conflict | Proxy Dynamic |
|----------|---------------|
| Korea (1950-53) | US vs. China/USSR |
| Vietnam (1955-75) | US vs. USSR/China |
| Afghanistan (1979-89) | USSR vs. US (mujahideen) |
| Angola (1975-2002) | US/S.Africa vs. USSR/Cuba |
| Nicaragua (1979-90) | US (Contras) vs. USSR (Sandinistas) |

## Contemporary Examples

### Middle East
- **Syria**: Russia/Iran vs. US/Gulf (various factions)
- **Yemen**: Saudi/UAE vs. Iran (Houthis)
- **Lebanon**: Iran (Hezbollah) vs. Israel
- **Gaza**: Iran (Hamas) vs. Israel

### Ukraine
- Pre-2022: Russia-backed separatists
- Post-2022: Western support to Ukraine

### Africa
- Libya, CAR, Mali, Sudan (various powers)

## Iran's Proxy Network
Exemplar of modern proxy strategy:
- **Hezbollah** (Lebanon): Most capable
- **Hamas/PIJ** (Palestine): Anti-Israel
- **Houthis** (Yemen): Anti-Saudi
- **Iraqi militias**: Multiple groups
- **Advantages**: Deniability, forward defense, regional influence

## Russia's Approach
- Wagner Group (Africa, Syria, Ukraine)
- Donbas separatists (2014-2022)
- Deniable operations
- Commercial/strategic blend

## Challenges of Proxy Warfare

### For Patrons
- Loss of control over proxy
- Proxy pursues own agenda
- Escalation risks
- Entanglement
- Reputation costs

### For Proxies
- Dependence on patron
- Expendability
- Conflicting agendas
- Blowback (trained fighters turn hostile)

## Principal-Agent Problems
- Proxies may not follow instructions
- Information asymmetry
- Monitoring difficulties
- Example: CIA/ISI vs. Afghan mujahideen → some became Taliban/AQ
