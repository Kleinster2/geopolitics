# Technology Competition

## Overview
Great power rivalry is increasingly fought in the technology domain. Control over key technologies - AI, semiconductors, quantum, biotech - will shape economic power, military capability, and global influence. The US-China tech war is the defining competition.

## Why Technology is Central

### Economic Power
- Innovation drives growth
- Technology sectors highest value
- Winner-take-all dynamics
- Productivity advantages

### Military Power
- Modern warfare = tech warfare
- AI, drones, cyber, space
- Technology edge = battlefield advantage
- Dual-use applications

### Global Influence
- Standards setting
- Technology diffusion
- Platform dominance
- Soft power through tech

## Key Technology Domains

### Artificial Intelligence
**The commanding heights**

| Aspect | US Position | China Position |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Research | Leading (OpenAI, Google) | Fast follower |
| Talent | Top global (immigration) | Large domestic pool |
| Compute | Advantage (chips) | Constrained |
| Data | Privacy constraints | Abundant (surveillance) |
| Applications | Commercial lead | State applications |

**Stakes**: AI will reshape economy, warfare, society

### Semiconductors
See: [[Semiconductors]]
- US controls design, equipment
- Taiwan manufactures
- China excluded from advanced
- Existential for both sides

### Quantum Computing
- Early stage
- Massive potential (cryptography, optimization)
- US, China, EU investing heavily
- Dual-use concerns

### Biotechnology
- Genetic engineering
- Synthetic biology
- Pandemic preparedness
- Agricultural applications
- Ethical debates

### Space Technology
- Satellite systems
- Launch capabilities
- Space-based assets (military)
- Commercial space boom
- US, China, private sector

### 5G/6G
- Network infrastructure
- Huawei vs. Western alternatives
- Intelligence concerns
- Standards competition
- National security implications

## US-China Tech War

### US Strategy

#### Goals
1. Maintain technology lead
2. Deny China military-use tech
3. Protect critical infrastructure
4. Preserve innovation ecosystem

#### Tools
- Export controls (semiconductors)
- Investment screening (CFIUS)
- Entity list (Huawei, etc.)
- Research security
- Ally coordination
- Industrial policy (CHIPS Act)

#### "Small Yard, High Fence"
- Not decoupling entirely
- Protecting critical technologies
- Chokepoint control
- Targeted restrictions

### China's Strategy

#### Goals
1. Technology self-sufficiency
2. Reduce vulnerabilities
3. Achieve leadership in key areas
4. Alternative standards/systems

#### Programs
- Made in China 2025
- Dual Circulation
- "Whole nation" system (集中力量)
- Talent recruitment
- Massive investment

#### Challenges
- Semiconductor gap
- Equipment access
- Talent constraints
- Quality vs. quantity

### Battlegrounds

| Domain | US Advantage | China Advantage |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| AI chips | Yes (Nvidia) | No |
| AI research | Yes | Closing |
| 5G infra | No (Huawei led) | Yes |
| EVs/batteries | No | Yes |
| Solar/wind | No | Yes |
| Quantum | Roughly equal | Roughly equal |
| Biotech | Yes | Growing |
| Space | Yes | Closing |

## Technology Decoupling

### Scope
- Semiconductor supply chains
- Data flows
- Research collaboration
- Investment restrictions
- Talent flows

### Not Total
- Consumer tech still flows
- Some cooperation continues
- Economic costs limit
- "De-risking" not decoupling

### Implications
- Parallel ecosystems possible
- Innovation costs (less sharing)
- Allies caught between
- Standards fragmentation

## Standards Competition

### Why Standards Matter
- Shape markets
- Lock in advantages
- Determine compatibility
- Influence global adoption

### Battlegrounds
- 5G/6G standards
- AI ethics/governance
- Data regulations
- Electric vehicle charging
- Internet protocols

### Organizations
- ITU, ISO, IEEE
- China increasing participation
- US counter-mobilization
- Technical standards = geopolitics

## Allied Technology Cooperation

### Frameworks
- US-EU Trade and Technology Council
- Quad technology cooperation
- AUKUS (defense tech)
- Chip 4 (semiconductors)

### Challenges
- Different interests (EU-China trade)
- Sovereignty concerns
- Coordination costs
- Technology nationalism

## Dual-Use Dilemma

### Definition
Technologies with both civilian and military applications.

### Examples
- AI (commercial + military)
- Semiconductors
- Aerospace
- Quantum
- Cyber capabilities

### Policy Challenge
- How to share commercially
- While restricting military use
- End-use monitoring difficult
- Innovation needs openness

## Talent Competition

### Critical Resource
- Scientists, engineers
- AI researchers especially
- Global competition for talent

### US Advantage
- Top universities
- Immigration tradition
- Research ecosystem
- Startup culture

### China's Approach
- Thousand Talents Program
- Returnee incentives
- Domestic education expansion
- Research investment

### Tensions
- Visa restrictions
- Research security
- Collaboration limits
- Brain drain concerns (China)

## Innovation Ecosystems

### US Model
- University-industry links
- Venture capital
- Risk tolerance
- Open immigration
- Market dynamism

### China Model
- State direction
- Massive investment
- Market scale
- Fast follow innovation
- Less basic research

### Neither Perfect
- US: Short-termism, inequality
- China: Creativity limits, capital misallocation

## Future Trajectories

### Scenarios

#### Continued Competition
- Rivalry intensifies
- Selective decoupling
- Two ecosystems
- Standards fragmentation

#### Managed Competition
- Guardrails established
- Some cooperation survives
- Domains separated
- Stability prioritized

#### Technology Cold War
- Full decoupling
- Bloc-based systems
- Zero-sum competition
- High costs for all
