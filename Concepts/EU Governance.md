# EU Governance

## Overview
Hub note connecting [[European Union]] institutional architecture. The EU's complex governance structure involves multiple bodies with overlapping competences, creating both checks and inefficiencies.

## Core Institutions

### Legislative

| Institution | Role | Composition |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| [[European Parliament]] | Co-legislator, budget approval, Commission oversight | 720 directly elected MEPs |
| [[Council of the EU]] | Co-legislator, represents member states | National ministers by policy area |

### Executive

| Institution | Role | Composition |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| [[European Commission]] | Proposes legislation, enforces treaties, negotiates trade | 27 Commissioners + President |
| [[European Council]] | Sets political direction | Heads of state/government |

### Judicial

| Institution | Role |
|-------------|------|
| [[Court of Justice of the EU]] | Interprets EU law, rules on treaty compatibility |

## Key Leaders (2024-2029)

| Position | Person | Note |
|----------|--------|------|
| Commission President | [[Ursula von der Leyen]] | Second term |
| Council President | [[António Costa]] | Since December 2024 |
| Parliament President | Roberta Metsola | EPP, Malta |
| High Representative | Kaja Kallas | Foreign policy chief |

## Decision-Making Procedures

### Ordinary Legislative Procedure
Most common method:
1. Commission proposes
2. Parliament and Council co-decide
3. Both must agree for adoption

### Trade Agreements
Per [[Lisbon Treaty]]:
1. Council authorizes negotiations
2. Commission negotiates
3. Council concludes (qualified majority or unanimity)
4. Parliament consents (cannot amend)
5. Court can rule on treaty compatibility

**Mixed vs EU-only agreements** determine whether national parliaments must also ratify. See [[EU-Mercosur FTA]] for controversy over this distinction.

## Competence Framework

Defined by [[Lisbon Treaty]]:

| Type | EU Role | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Exclusive** | Only EU acts | Trade policy, customs, competition |
| **Shared** | Both can act | Environment, transport, energy |
| **Supporting** | EU supports only | Culture, education, health |

## Current Issues

### Democratic Deficit
- Commission not directly elected
- Parliament cannot initiate legislation
- Complex procedures reduce transparency
- Low turnout in EP elections

### Institutional Tensions
- Commission vs Parliament (Mercosur referral)
- Council unanimity blocking action
- National courts vs Court of Justice (supremacy debates)

### Reform Debates
- Treaty change for more integration?
- Qualified majority voting expansion
- Fiscal union questions
- Defense integration

## Trade Policy Architecture

```
Commission negotiates
        ↓
Council authorizes/concludes
        ↓
Parliament consents
        ↓
(If mixed: 27 national parliaments ratify)
        ↓
Court can review compatibility
```

Current examples:
- [[EU-India FTA]] - Signing January 2026
- [[EU-Mercosur FTA]] - Signed but referred to Court
- [[CETA]] - Provisionally applied, awaiting full ratification
- [[Brexit]] - Withdrawal completed 2020
