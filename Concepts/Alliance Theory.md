# Alliance Theory

## Overview
Why do states form alliances? How do they work? When do they fail? Alliance formation is a core behavior in international politics, driven by threats, shared interests, and strategic calculations. Understanding alliances is essential for analyzing geopolitics.

## What is an Alliance?

### Definition
A formal or informal commitment between two or more states for mutual security assistance.

### Types
- **Formal**: Treaty-based (NATO, US-Japan)
- **Informal**: Tacit understanding (US-Israel)
- **Defensive**: Against external attack
- **Offensive**: Joint aggression
- **Asymmetric**: Unequal partners (patron-client)

## Why States Ally

### Balance of Threat Theory (Stephen Walt)

States ally against threats, not just power. Threat =

```
Power + Proximity + Offensive Capability + Aggressive Intentions
```

**Key insight**: States balance against threats, not necessarily the most powerful state.

### Balancing vs. Bandwagoning

| Balancing | Bandwagoning |
|-----------|--------------|
| Join weaker side against threat | Join stronger/threatening side |
| More common historically | Happens when balancing hopeless |
| Preserves autonomy | Sacrifices autonomy for survival |
| Balance of power logic | Appeasement logic |

**When states bandwagon:**
- Very weak (can't balance)
- Threat is overwhelming
- No allies available
- Benefits outweigh costs

### Other Motivations

#### Interests
- Economic benefits
- Technology access
- Prestige
- Shared ideology

#### Domestic Politics
- Regime security
- Legitimacy
- Intra-elite bargaining

#### Identity
- Shared values
- Common enemies
- Historical ties

## Alliance Dilemmas

### Abandonment vs. Entrapment (Glenn Snyder)

Every alliance faces two risks:

#### Abandonment
- Ally won't honor commitment
- Left alone when needed
- Credibility concerns

#### Entrapment
- Dragged into ally's conflicts
- Unwanted wars
- Loss of autonomy

**Trade-off**: Tight alliance → less abandonment, more entrapment risk

### Security vs. Autonomy Trade-off

More security from alliance → Less freedom of action

```

     Low└─────────────────────

              Autonomy
```

### Free-Riding

Members may under-contribute, relying on others:
- Burden-sharing disputes
- Collective action problem
- NATO 2% debates

### Chain-Ganging vs. Buck-Passing

- **Chain-ganging**: Allies dragged into war (WWI)
- **Buck-passing**: Hoping others will handle threat

## Alliance Credibility

### What Makes Commitments Credible?

1. **Interests**: Ally shares your interests
2. **Capability**: Ally can actually help
3. **Reputation**: History of honoring commitments
4. **Signals**: Troops deployed, resources committed
5. **Domestic support**: Political will to act

### Credibility Problem

> "Would the US trade New York for Berlin?"

Extended deterrence requires allies to believe:
- You will fight for them
- Against a nuclear adversary
- When your own territory is safe

## Alliance Management

### Keeping Alliances Together

- Reassurance (credibility)
- Restraint (prevent entrapment)
- Communication
- Burden-sharing
- Adaptation to new threats

### Why Alliances End

1. **Threat disappears**: No longer needed
2. **Diverging interests**: Priorities shift
3. **Credibility collapse**: Lost trust
4. **Better alternatives**: New partners
5. **Domestic change**: Government shifts

## Alliance Effectiveness

### When Alliances Work
- Clear shared threat
- Complementary capabilities
- Leadership/coordination
- Political commitment
- Interoperability

### When Alliances Fail
- Misaligned interests
- Free-riding
- Coordination problems
- Credibility doubts
- Domestic politics

## Major Alliance Systems

### NATO
- Most successful alliance in history?
- Survived end of Cold War
- Article 5 cornerstone
- Challenges: Burden-sharing, purpose
- See: [[NATO]]

### US Hub-and-Spoke (Asia)
- Bilateral alliances
- Japan, South Korea, Australia, Philippines, Thailand
- No Asian NATO
- Different from European model

### Russia's Alliances
- CSTO (weak)
- Bilateral (Belarus, Syria)
- Limited alliance capacity
- Prefers client states

### China's Approach
- Only formal ally: North Korea
- Strategic partnerships instead
- Avoids alliance commitments
- Flexibility preference

## Alliance Dynamics Today

### US Alliances
- Reassurance efforts post-Trump
- Indo-Pacific focus
- Burden-sharing pressure
- Extended deterrence questions

### New Formations
- AUKUS (technology-focused)
- Quad (informal)
- Minilaterals rising

### Alliance Adaptation
- New threats (cyber, space)
- China focus
- Out-of-area operations
- Values-based cooperation
