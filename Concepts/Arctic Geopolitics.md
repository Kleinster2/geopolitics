# Arctic Geopolitics

## Overview
Climate change is transforming the Arctic from frozen periphery to strategic frontier. Melting ice opens new shipping routes, reveals vast resources, and creates new military competition. Russia dominates geographically; China claims "near-Arctic" status. Growing great power competition zone.

## Why the Arctic Matters

### Climate Change Effects
- Sea ice declining dramatically
- Northern Sea Route opening
- Northwest Passage more navigable
- Permafrost thawing
- Feedback loops accelerating warming

### Strategic Drivers
- New shipping routes
- Hydrocarbon resources
- Mineral deposits
- Military positioning
- Scientific research

## Arctic States

### Arctic Council Members
1. **Russia** - Longest coastline, most infrastructure
2. **Canada** - Second largest Arctic territory
3. **United States** - Alaska
4. **Norway** - Svalbard, northern coast
5. **Denmark** - Via Greenland
6. **Finland** - Arctic territory
7. **Sweden** - Arctic territory
8. **Iceland** - North Atlantic

### Non-Arctic Interests
- **China** - "Near-Arctic state" claim
- **EU** - Observer status
- **Others** - India, Japan, South Korea observers

## Russian Arctic Dominance

### Geographic Reality
- 53% of Arctic coastline
- 40% of Arctic territory
- Northern Sea Route control
- Most infrastructure
- Largest Arctic population

### Military Buildup
- Reopened Soviet-era bases
- New icebreaker fleet
- Arctic brigades
- Air defense systems
- Nuclear submarine bases

### Economic Stakes
- 20% of Russian GDP from Arctic
- Vast hydrocarbon reserves
- Nickel, palladium, rare earths
- Northern Sea Route revenue

### Northern Sea Route
- Russia controls
- Requires Russian icebreakers
- Fees charged
- Strategic vulnerability concern
- Ice-free periods increasing

## Shipping Routes

### Northern Sea Route (NSR)
- Along Russian coast
- Cuts Europe-Asia distance 40%
- Seasonal (expanding)
- Russian control/escorts
- Still limited traffic

### Northwest Passage
- Through Canadian Arctic
- Canada claims internal waters
- US disputes (international strait)
- Less developed than NSR
- Climate opening faster

### Transpolar Route
- Across central Arctic
- Future possibility
- Requires more ice melt
- True shortcut

### Comparison
| Route | Distance (Europe-Asia) | Season |
|-------|----------------------|--------|
| Suez Canal | ~21,000 km | Year-round |
| Northern Sea Route | ~14,000 km | Seasonal |
| Northwest Passage | ~16,000 km | Very limited |

## Resources

### Hydrocarbons
- 13% of undiscovered oil
- 30% of undiscovered gas
- Most in Russian zone
- Extraction challenging
- Climate paradox

### Minerals
- Rare earth elements
- Nickel, copper, zinc
- Greenland potential
- See: [[Critical Minerals]]

### Fisheries
- Shifting northward
- New fishing grounds
- Governance challenges

## China in the Arctic

### "Near-Arctic State"
- Self-declared status (2018)
- No Arctic territory
- Claims economic/scientific interests
- "Polar Silk Road"

### Activities
- Research stations
- Icebreaker program
- Investment attempts (Greenland)
- Russian partnerships
- Shipping route interest

### Concerns
- Military potential
- Resource access
- Infrastructure investment
- Dual-use research
- Strategic positioning

## US Arctic Policy

### Geographic Position
- Alaska only Arctic territory
- Distant from Arctic center
- Limited icebreaker fleet
- Playing catch-up
- Thule Air Base in Greenland (Danish territory)

### Strategic Awakening
- Arctic strategy updated
- New icebreaker program
- Alaska base investments
- NATO coordination
- China/Russia concerns

### 2026 Greenland Crisis
- Trump openly threatening **forcible annexation** of Greenland
- Unprecedented: NATO ally threatening NATO ally
- Cites strategic Arctic importance
- European troops deploying to Greenland in response
- Danish PM: Would end NATO if US attacks
- See: [[Greenland Crisis]], [[Greenland]], [[Denmark]]

### Icebreaker Gap
| Country | Heavy Icebreakers |
|---------|-------------------|
| Russia | 40+ |
| US | 2 (aging) |
| China | 2 (growing) |

## NATO and the Arctic

### Nordic Expansion
- Finland joined NATO (2023)
- Sweden joined NATO (2024)
- Arctic alliance coverage
- Russian concern

### Implications
- Russia's Arctic flank exposed
- NATO coordination possible
- Arctic exercises
- But: No NATO Arctic command

### Norway Role
- NATO Arctic anchor
- Russian border
- Intelligence
- High North focus

## Governance

### Arctic Council
- Primary forum (est. 1996)
- Eight Arctic states
- Indigenous representation
- Science, environment focus
- Security excluded

### Post-Ukraine
- Russia participation suspended
- Council function limited
- Bilateral continues
- Uncertain future

### Legal Framework
- UNCLOS applies
- Continental shelf claims
- EEZ rights
- Some disputes remain

## Environmental Dimension

### Climate Feedback
- Arctic warming 4x faster
- Ice loss accelerates warming
- Permafrost methane release
- Global implications

### Conservation vs. Exploitation
- Resource development pressure
- Ecosystem protection
- Indigenous rights
- Sustainability challenges

## Indigenous Peoples

### Arctic Populations
- Inuit (Canada, Greenland)
- Sami (Scandinavia)
- Various Russian peoples

### Issues
- Self-determination
- Climate impacts
- Resource development
- Traditional livelihoods

## Future Scenarios

### Cooperation
- Climate necessitates
- Scientific collaboration
- Resource co-development
- Low probability currently

### Competition
- Military buildup
- Resource race
- Route control
- Most likely trajectory

### Conflict
- Incident escalation
- Resource disputes
- Navigation freedom
- Lower probability but rising
