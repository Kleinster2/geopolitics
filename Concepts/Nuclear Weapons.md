# Nuclear Weapons

## Overview
The most destructive weapons ever created, fundamentally altering international politics since 1945. Nuclear weapons provide ultimate deterrence but their use could end civilization. The threat of nuclear war shapes great power relations, alliances, and regional security.

## Why Nuclear Weapons Matter for Geopolitics

### Strategic Impact
1. **Existential stakes**: Survival itself at risk
2. **Deterrence foundation**: Prevents great power war
3. **Status symbol**: P5 permanent membership
4. **Alliance cornerstone**: Extended deterrence to allies
5. **Crisis behavior**: Constrains escalation
6. **Sovereignty guarantee**: Ultimate insurance policy

### The Nuclear Revolution
- Pre-1945: War could be "won"
- Post-1945: Total war → mutual annihilation
- Great power war became irrational
- "Long peace" since WWII

## Global Nuclear Arsenal (2024)

| Country | Warheads | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Russia | ~5,580 | Largest arsenal |
| United States | ~5,044 | Second largest |
| China | ~500 | Rapidly expanding |
| France | ~290 | Independent deterrent |
| United Kingdom | ~225 | US cooperation |
| Pakistan | ~170 | India-focused |
| India | ~172 | China/Pakistan focused |
| Israel | ~90 (est.) | Undeclared |
| North Korea | ~50-60 (est.) | Growing |

**Total**: ~12,500 warheads globally

## Types of Nuclear Weapons

### By Yield
- **Tactical/Battlefield**: <20 kt (smaller than Hiroshima)
- **Strategic**: Hundreds of kt to megatons
- **Thermonuclear (H-bomb)**: Most powerful

### By Delivery
- **ICBMs**: Intercontinental ballistic missiles (land-based)
- **SLBMs**: Submarine-launched ballistic missiles
- **Bombers**: Aircraft-delivered (gravity bombs, cruise missiles)
- **Tactical**: Short-range, battlefield use

### The "Triad"
Complete nuclear deterrent includes:
1. Land-based ICBMs (fast, accurate, vulnerable)
2. Sea-based SLBMs (survivable, second-strike)
3. Bomber aircraft (flexible, recallable)

US, Russia, China, India have/building triads.

## Nuclear Deterrence

### Core Logic
- Attack me → I destroy you
- Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD)
- Requires survivable second-strike capability
- Credibility essential

### Concepts
- **First strike**: Attacking first
- **Second strike**: Retaliating after absorbing attack
- **Launch on warning**: Fire before enemy missiles arrive
- **Counterforce**: Targeting enemy weapons
- **Countervalue**: Targeting cities (assured destruction)

### Extended Deterrence
- Nuclear umbrella for allies
- US protects NATO, Japan, South Korea, Australia
- Credibility questioned: "Would US trade New York for Berlin?"

## Arms Control

### Major Treaties
| Treaty | Parties | Limits |
|--------|---------|--------|
| New START | US-Russia | 1,550 deployed strategic |
| NPT | 191 states | Non-proliferation framework |
| CTBT | Not in force | Bans testing |
| INF | Collapsed 2019 | Was: No intermediate missiles |

### Current Status
- New START expires 2026
- No successor negotiations
- INF Treaty dead
- CTBT not ratified (US, China)
- Regime under stress

## Nuclear Postures

### United States
- Triad modernization underway ($1.7T over 30 years)
- No first use: not declared
- Sole purpose debate
- Extended deterrence commitments

### Russia
- Largest arsenal, modernizing
- "Escalate to de-escalate" doctrine (debated)
- Tactical nuclear emphasis
- Ukraine war threats

### China
- Rapid expansion (500 → 1,000+ by 2030?)
- No first use declared (questioned)
- Historically minimal deterrent
- Changing posture

### France/UK
- Independent deterrents
- Minimum deterrence
- Sea-based emphasis

### India/Pakistan
- Regional deterrence
- First use doctrines differ
- Crisis stability concerns

## Proliferation Risks

### Current Concerns
- [[Iran Nuclear Program]]
- [[North Korea]]
- Saudi hedging
- Regional cascades

### Why States Seek Bombs
- Security guarantees inadequate
- Existential threats
- Prestige
- Regime survival
- See: [[Nuclear Proliferation]]

## Nuclear Taboo

### Concept
- Norm against use (since 1945)
- Social/political constraints
- Strengthened over decades
- Under pressure?

### Challenges
- Russia threats (Ukraine)
- Tactical nuclear weapons
- Erosion concerns
- Regional conflicts

## Nuclear War Risks

### Scenarios
1. **Deliberate**: Calculated first strike (least likely)
2. **Inadvertent**: Miscalculation, false warning
3. **Accidental**: Technical failure
4. **Escalation**: Conventional war spirals
5. **Unauthorized**: Rogue launch

### Risk Factors
- Great power tensions
- Emerging technology (hypersonics, AI)
- Command and control vulnerabilities
- More nuclear states
- Arms control collapse

## Consequences of Use

### Immediate
- Blast destruction
- Radiation
- Mass casualties (millions in city attack)

### Extended
- Nuclear winter possibility
- Global economic collapse
- Environmental devastation
- Civilizational risk
