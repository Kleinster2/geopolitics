# Zeitenwende

## Definition
German for "turning point" or "watershed moment." Refers to the declared transformation of German foreign and defense policy following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, announced by Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a landmark Bundestag speech on February 27, 2022.

## The Speech (February 27, 2022)

Three days after Russia invaded Ukraine, Scholz addressed the Bundestag and announced:

1. **€100 billion special fund** (Sondervermögen) for Bundeswehr modernization
2. **Commitment to 2% GDP** defense spending (NATO target)
3. **Reversal of decades-long policy** of military restraint
4. **Arms exports to conflict zones** (broke previous taboo by sending weapons to Ukraine)

Scholz described Russia's invasion as ending the post-Cold War European security order.

## What Changed (In Theory)

### Before Zeitenwende
- Germany spent ~1.3% GDP on defense
- Chronic underinvestment since reunification (30 years)
- Reluctance to deploy military force
- Heavy energy dependence on Russia (Nord Stream)
- "Wandel durch Handel" (change through trade) with Russia/China

### After Zeitenwende (Declared Goals)
- 2%+ GDP defense spending
- Modernized, deployable Bundeswehr
- Reduced Russian energy dependence
- Leadership role in European defense
- More assertive foreign policy

## Progress Assessment (2022-2025)

### Achievements
- **Hit 2% target in 2024** (first time in decades)
- **Major procurement orders**: F-35A fighters, upgraded Puma IFVs, naval frigates
- **Second-largest Ukraine donor** (after US) - from initial 5,000 helmets to billions in military aid
- **Nord Stream dependence ended** (partly involuntary after sabotage)

### Ongoing Problems
Per Bundeswehr Parliamentary Commissioner reports:
- **"Too little of everything"** - equipment shortages persist
- **Missed recruitment targets** - aging force
- **Crumbling infrastructure** - barracks, basic facilities
- **Procurement delays** - bureaucratic inefficiencies
- **Funding gap**: €25-30 billion annually to sustain 2% after special fund expires (~2027)

### Political Criticism

Bavaria's Minister-President Markus Söder:
> "Everyone is talking about Zeitenwende, but so far we've only seen Zeitlupe [slow motion]."

Critics argue Scholz spent just enough to meet 2% minimum, not enough to address decades of underfunding.

## The Sustainability Problem

The €100 billion special fund is **off-budget** and expires around 2027. Regular defense budget frozen at ~€50 billion through 2026.

**The math:**
- 2% of GDP ≈ €75-80 billion annually
- Regular budget: €50 billion
- Gap: €25-30 billion/year
- Special fund covers gap temporarily, then what?

The Merz government (2025-) inherits this challenge.

## Strategic Implications

### For NATO
- Germany as capable military partner (if Zeitenwende succeeds)
- Burden-sharing debates potentially resolved
- But dependence on US umbrella remains

### For European Defense
- German leadership role in [[European Nuclear Debate]]?
- Franco-German defense cooperation
- EU strategic autonomy debates

### For Zeihan's Thesis
[[Peter Zeihan]] argues Europe must spend "5x as much on defense" given US retrenchment. Zeitenwende moves in this direction but may be insufficient if US withdraws from European security.

## The Merz Era (2025-)

Friedrich Merz (CDU) government faces:
- Sustaining spending after special fund expires
- Actual capability building vs. budget targets
- Balancing fiscal constraints with defense needs
- Potential pressure from Trump administration for more
