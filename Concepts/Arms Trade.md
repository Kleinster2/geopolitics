# Arms Trade

## Overview
The international transfer of military weapons, equipment, and technology. A major tool of geopolitical influence - arms sales create dependencies, cement alliances, and shift regional balances. A $100+ billion annual global market with profound strategic implications.

## Why Arms Trade Matters

### For Exporters
- **Influence**: Creates dependency, binds recipients
- **Access**: Bases, intelligence, political leverage
- **Economics**: Defense industry jobs, trade balance
- **Interoperability**: Recipients use your systems
- **Signals**: Demonstrates commitment to allies

### For Importers
- **Capability**: Acquire what can't produce domestically
- **Alliance signal**: Ties to major power
- **Deterrence**: Credible defense posture
- **Prestige**: Status symbol
- **Technology access**: Sometimes includes transfers

## Global Market
