# Open Skies Treaty

## Overview
Confidence-building treaty allowing unarmed aerial observation flights over member states' territories. Signed 1992, entered force 2002. Designed to promote transparency and reduce tensions through mutual openness. Collapsed when US withdrew November 2020, followed by Russia in December 2021.

## Key Facts

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Signed | March 24, 1992 (Helsinki) |
| Entered force | January 1, 2002 |
| US withdrawal | November 22, 2020 |
| Russia withdrawal | December 18, 2021 |
| Remaining parties | 32 states |

## How It Worked

### Observation Flights
- Unarmed aircraft with approved sensors
- Overfly any territory of member states
- Short-notice flights permitted
- Host nation could fly along

### Sensors Allowed
- Optical cameras
- Video cameras
- Infrared sensors
- Synthetic aperture radar

### Quotas
- Each state had passive quota (flights it must accept)
- Active quota (flights it could conduct)
- Based on geographic size

## Purpose

### Transparency
- See military deployments directly
- Verify arms control compliance
- Reduce uncertainty about intentions
- Supplement satellite reconnaissance

### Confidence Building
- Mutual vulnerability builds trust
- Routine cooperation
- Crisis de-escalation tool
- European security architecture element

## Collapse

### US Withdrawal (2020)
- Trump administration announced May 2020
- Cited Russian violations and restrictions
- Effective November 22, 2020
- Biden administration did not rejoin

### Russian Allegations
- US shared imagery with non-member Ukraine
- US restricted flights over Alaska, Hawaii
- Withdrawal was predetermined

### Russian Withdrawal (2021)
- Announced January 2021
- Effective December 18, 2021
- Cited US withdrawal
- Noted remaining members could still share with US

## What Was Lost

### For Europe
- Direct observation of Russian territory
- Independent verification capability
- Not all European states have satellites
- Relied on US sharing

### For Arms Control
- Another transparency mechanism gone
- Pattern: INF (2019), Open Skies (2020), New START (2026)
- Verification architecture eroding
- Trust deficit deepens

## Current Status

### Remaining Parties
- 32 states continue
- Canada, most European states
- Flights continue among members
- Russia no longer participates

### Relevance
- Ukraine conflict increased demand for transparency
- No mechanism for observing Russia
- European states exploring alternatives
- Satellite capabilities uneven
