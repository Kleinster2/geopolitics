# Chokepoints

## Overview
Narrow passages through which maritime traffic must pass, creating strategic vulnerabilities and control opportunities. Control of chokepoints has been central to naval strategy for centuries. Today, with globalized trade dependent on sea lanes, their importance has grown.

## Why Chokepoints Matter

### Strategic Value
- Concentrate traffic
- Enable monitoring
- Allow interdiction
- Create leverage
- Naval power multiplier

### Economic Stakes
- Global trade flows
- Energy shipments
- Supply chains
- Just-in-time vulnerability
- See: [[Supply Chains]]

## Major Global Chokepoints

### Strait of Hormuz
| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Location | Persian Gulf exit |
| Width | 34 km (21 mi) |
| Traffic | 20% of global oil |
| Controller | Iran (north shore) |
| Risk level | High |

**Significance**:
- World's most important oil chokepoint
- Iran threatens closure periodically
- US Fifth Fleet presence
- Tanker attacks occurred
- See: [[Iran]], [[Middle East]]

### Strait of Malacca
| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Location | Singapore-Indonesia-Malaysia |
| Width | 2.8 km narrowest |
| Traffic | 25% of global trade |
| Controllers | Three states |
| Risk level | Moderate |

**Significance**:
- Shortest Asia-Europe route
- China's "Malacca Dilemma"
- Piracy history
- Singapore's importance
- See: [[Asia-Pacific]]

### Suez Canal
| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Location | Egypt |
| Length | 193 km |
| Traffic | 12-15% of global trade |
| Controller | Egypt |
| Risk level | Moderate |

**Significance**:
- Europe-Asia shortcut
- Ever Given blockage (2021) showed vulnerability
- Revenue for Egypt
- Expansion completed
- See: [[Egypt]], [[Middle East]]

### Bab el-Mandeb
| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Location | Red Sea-Gulf of Aden |
| Width | 26 km |
| Traffic | 10% of global trade |
| Adjacent | Yemen, Djibouti |
| Risk level | High |

**Significance**:
- Links Red Sea to Indian Ocean
- Houthi attacks on shipping (2023-24)
- Military base concentration
- Suez route dependent
- See: [[Houthis]], [[Yemen]]

### Panama Canal
| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Location | Panama |
| Length | 82 km |
| Traffic | 5% of global trade |
| Controller | Panama |
| Risk level | Low-Moderate |

**Significance**:
- Atlantic-Pacific shortcut
- US strategic interest
- Expansion completed (2016)
- Drought affecting operations
- Climate vulnerability

### Turkish Straits
| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Straits | Bosphorus, Dardanelles |
| Traffic | Russian exports |
| Controller | Turkey |
| Risk level | Moderate |

**Significance**:
- Black Sea access only route
- Russia historically sought control
- Montreux Convention governs
- Ukraine war relevance
- See: [[Turkey]], [[Russia]]

### GIUK Gap
| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Location | Greenland-Iceland-UK |
| Width | ~500 km |
| Traffic | Naval (not commercial) |
| Significance | Submarine passage |

**Significance**:
- Cold War submarine hunting ground
- Russian submarine route
- NATO surveillance
- Renewed importance

## Asian Chokepoints

### Lombok Strait
- Alternative to Malacca
- Deeper (larger ships)
- Longer route
- Indonesian control

### Sunda Strait
- Between Java-Sumatra
- Alternative route
- Indonesian control
- Less traffic than Malacca

### Taiwan Strait
- Taiwan-China mainland
- Commercial traffic
- Political flashpoint
- PLA Navy exercises
- See: [[Taiwan]]

### Miyako Strait
- Okinawa-Miyako islands
- China naval route to Pacific
- Japanese monitoring
- First island chain gap

### Tsushima Strait
- Japan-Korea
- Russian Pacific Fleet access
- Historical naval battles
- Monitored passage

## Strategic Implications

### For Great Powers

**United States**:
- Navy protects sea lanes
- Forward presence
- Alliance network
- Freedom of navigation

**China**:
- "Malacca Dilemma"
- Seeks alternatives (pipelines, overland)
- String of Pearls (port access)
- Navy modernization

**Russia**:
- Limited warm-water access
- Turkish Straits constraint
- Arctic alternative sought
- Baltic/Black Sea limitations

### For Trade
- Disruption costs
- Insurance spikes
- Rerouting delays
- Inventory buffers needed

### For Energy
- Oil/LNG vulnerability
- Strategic reserves importance
- Pipeline alternatives
- Diversification pressure

## Vulnerabilities

### Military Threats
- Blockade
- Mining
- Missile attack
- Naval interdiction

### Non-State Threats
- Piracy (Malacca, Somalia)
- Terrorism
- Houthi attacks
- Militia actions

### Natural/Infrastructure
- Weather
- Accidents (Ever Given)
- Climate (Panama drought)
- Maintenance needs

## Alternatives and Bypasses

### Land Routes
- China's Belt and Road
- Russia pipelines
- Land bridges

### Alternative Sea Routes
- Cape of Good Hope (avoid Suez)
- Arctic routes (emerging)
- Lombok vs. Malacca

### Pipelines
- China-Myanmar
- China-Central Asia
- Reduce maritime dependence

## Historical Chokepoints Conflicts

### Suez Crisis (1956)
- British/French/Israeli intervention
- US forced withdrawal
- Decolonization marker

### Tanker War (1980s)
- Iran-Iraq War spillover
- US reflagging
- Strait of Hormuz tension

### Gulf War (1991)
- Kuwait liberation
- Oil supply security
- Coalition naval power

## Future Considerations

### Climate Change
- Arctic routes opening
- Panama water levels
- New patterns

### Technology
- Larger ships (draft constraints)
- Autonomous vessels
- Surveillance improvements

### Geopolitics
- China's port investments
- Naval competition
- Regional instability
