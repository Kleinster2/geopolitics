# Predatory Hegemony

## Overview
Term coined by [[Stephen Walt]] (Harvard, January 2026) to describe Trump's approach to international relations. Unlike traditional hegemony where great powers prey on adversaries, predatory hegemony extends extraction and coercion to **allies** as well.

## Definition

> "All great powers are predators to some degree, but they usually confine their acts of predation to their adversaries. In any deal with an adversary, you want to make sure you get the better of that arrangement. But what Trump has done is he's applying that to our allies as well. In all bilateral relationships, his view is: what's mine is mine, what's yours is negotiable."
> — Stephen Walt, January 2026

## Key Features

### Traditional Hegemony vs. Predatory Hegemony

| Traditional Hegemony | Predatory Hegemony |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Prey on adversaries | Prey on everyone |
| Protect allies | Extract from allies |
| Build coalitions | Bilateral extraction |
| Long-term relationships | Transactional deals |
| Provide public goods | Demand payment for protection |

### The Logic
- Every relationship is zero-sum
- Maximize extraction in every deal
- Use leverage wherever it exists
- Allies are vulnerable = allies are targets
- "What's mine is mine, what's yours is negotiable"

## Examples (2026)

### South Korea
- Threat: Massive tariffs on Korean economy
- Demand: Investment in United States, concessions list
- Leverage: Security dependence, trade exposure

### Greenland/Denmark
- Threat: Forcible annexation
- Demand: Territorial control
- Reality: No security need (US already has treaty access)
- Walt: "This is all about essentially marking territory"

### Europe Broadly
- Threat: Tariffs, security withdrawal
- Demand: Defense spending, trade concessions
- Approach: "Flatter Trump, then get hit anyway"

### Venezuela
- Action: Regime capture
- Framing: Drugs, democracy
- Reality: Hemispheric dominance, [[Monroe Doctrine]] enforcement
- Message to Latin America: "We're going to run it"

## Why It Works (Short Term)

Against allies specifically:
- They're **dependent** on US security
- They've underinvested in alternatives
- They can't retaliate effectively
- They're reluctant to balance against US
- Accommodation instinct runs deep

## Why It Fails (Long Term)

### Walt's Prediction
> "It works in the short term, but not if you realize that the predator can't be accommodated, that each demand is just going to be met by another demand down the road."

### Allied Responses Already Underway
- **Canada**: Diversifying trade relationships
- **EU**: Signed Mercosur deal after years of delay
- **Europe**: Building independent defense capacity
- **General**: Less reliance on single partner

### The Lesson Learned
Countries that **pushed back** (Brazil, China) did better than those who tried to accommodate. This teaches allies: accommodation doesn't work.

## Connection to Other Concepts

### [[Melian Dialogue]]
Both involve the strong dominating the weak. But Melian logic applied to adversaries is traditional; applying it to allies is the innovation.

### [[Spheres of Influence]]
Predatory hegemony is one way to maintain a sphere - through extraction rather than protection.

### [[Pax Americana]]
Represents a departure from the post-1945 model where US provided public goods in exchange for allied cooperation.

### [[Gunboat Diplomacy]]
The military enforcement arm of predatory hegemony.

## Implications

### For Allies
- Diversify relationships now
- Build independent capabilities
- Consider pushing back vs. accommodating
- Security dependence = vulnerability

### For International Order
- Alliance system erodes
- Trust collapses
- Self-help intensifies
- [[Pax Americana]] ends

### For the US
- Short-term gains, long-term isolation
- Allies become less capable partners
- Coalitions harder to build
- Legitimacy costs
