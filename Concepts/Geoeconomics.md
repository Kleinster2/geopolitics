# Geoeconomics

## Definition
The use of economic instruments to achieve geopolitical objectives, and the geopolitical implications of economic activities. Where geopolitics meets economics - using trade, investment, sanctions, and financial power as tools of statecraft.

## Origin
- Term coined by **Edward Luttwak** (1990)
- Argued post-Cold War would see economic competition replace military
- "The logic of conflict in the grammar of commerce"

### Geoeconomics vs. International Political Economy (IPE)

| Geoeconomics | IPE |
|--------------|-----|
| Economics as *tool* of power | Economics as *subject* of study |
| Strategic/policy focus | Academic/analytical |
| State-centric | Multiple actors |
| Competition emphasis | Also studies cooperation |
| Prescriptive | Descriptive/explanatory |

## Tools of Geoeconomics

### Trade Policy
- Tariffs and trade wars
- Market access leverage
- Export controls
- Trade agreements as strategic tools

### Sanctions
- Financial sanctions
- Trade embargoes
- Secondary sanctions
- Sectoral targeting
- See: [[Sanctions]]

### Investment
- Foreign direct investment (FDI) as influence
- Investment screening (blocking)
- Sovereign wealth funds
- Strategic acquisitions

### Finance/Currency
- Dollar dominance
- SWIFT access
- Reserve currency status
- Central bank policies
- Debt diplomacy

### Supply Chains
- Chokepoint control
- Critical technology denial
- Reshoring/friend-shoring
- Dependency creation

### Aid and Development
- Conditional assistance
- Infrastructure investment
- Debt-trap debates
- Development finance competition

## Weaponized Interdependence

### Concept (Farrell & Newman, 2019)
Globalization created networks with:
- **Hub nodes** (concentrated control points)
- States controlling hubs can weaponize them

### Key Chokepoints

| Domain | Chokepoint | Controller |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Finance | SWIFT | US/EU |
| Finance | Dollar clearing | US |
| Tech | Semiconductors | Taiwan/US |
| Tech | Rare earths | China |
| Data | Cloud/internet | US firms |
| Energy | LNG | US/Qatar |

### How It Works
1. Interdependence creates vulnerabilities
2. Controlling nodes = leverage
3. Can surveil (panopticon effect)
4. Can exclude (chokepoint effect)

## Geoeconomics by Actor

### United States
**Instruments:**
- Dollar dominance
- SWIFT access control
- Export controls (semiconductors)
- Sanctions (Iran, Russia, etc.)
- CFIUS investment screening

**Strategy:**
- Maintain financial primacy
- Technology denial to rivals
- Alliance economic coordination
- "De-risking" from China

### China
**Instruments:**
- Belt and Road Initiative
- Market access leverage
- Rare earth dominance
- Economic coercion (Australia, Lithuania)
- Digital Yuan ambitions

**Strategy:**
- Build dependencies
- Reduce own vulnerabilities
- Alternative financial systems
- Tech self-sufficiency
- See: [[Belt and Road Initiative]]

### European Union
**Instruments:**
- Single market access
- Regulatory power ("Brussels effect")
- Trade agreements
- Sanctions coordination
- Anti-coercion instrument (new)

**Strategy:**
- Strategic autonomy
- Values-based trade
- Supply chain resilience
- Less dependent on US/China

### Russia
**Instruments:**
- Energy leverage (gas)
- Food exports (grain)
- Sanctions evasion
- Alternative payment systems

**Strategy:**
- Weaponize dependencies
- Survive sanctions
- "Fortress Russia"
- Partner with China

## Case Studies

### US-China Tech War
- Huawei restrictions
- Semiconductor export controls
- Entity list
- CHIPS Act subsidies
- Decoupling/de-risking

### Russia Sanctions (2022)
- SWIFT exclusion (partial)
- Central bank freeze
- Oil price cap
- Export controls
- Most comprehensive ever on major economy

### China Economic Coercion
- Australia: Trade restrictions (political dispute)
- Lithuania: Blocked over Taiwan office
- South Korea: THAAD retaliation
- Philippines: Banana/tourism pressure

### BRI Debt Diplomacy
- Sri Lanka Hambantota port
- Zambia debt
- Pakistan CPEC strains
- Debate: Trap or development?

## Geoeconomics and Security

### Economics as Weapon
- Sanctions damage economies
- Technology denial degrades military
- Financial exclusion isolates
- Supply chain control = leverage

### Economics as Target
- Critical infrastructure protection
- Supply chain security
- Investment screening
- Economic espionage

### Economics and War
- Sanctions as alternative to war
- Economic pressure before/during conflict
- War costs (trade disruption)
- Economic warfare

## Limits of Geoeconomics

### Effectiveness Questions
- Sanctions rarely change behavior on core interests
- Economic coercion creates resentment
- Targets adapt and evade
- Collateral damage to self

### Costs
- Trade disruption hurts both sides
- Financial weaponization undermines dollar
- Supply chain reshoring is expensive
- Alliance friction

### Blowback
- Alternative systems develop
- De-dollarization efforts
- Self-sufficiency drives
- Fragmentation of global economy

## The New Geoeconomic Era

### Trends
1. Economics increasingly weaponized
2. Supply chain security prioritized
3. Industrial policy returns
4. Blocs forming (friend-shoring)
5. Technology as battlefield

### Key Tensions
- Efficiency vs. security
- Interdependence vs. autonomy
- Globalization vs. fragmentation
- Markets vs. states

### Future
- More economic statecraft
- Less pure free trade
- Strategic competition in economic domain
- New institutions/blocs?
