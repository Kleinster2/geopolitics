# Critical Minerals

## Overview
The minerals essential for modern technology, defense systems, and especially the clean energy transition. Control over these resources is becoming a key arena of geopolitical competition, with China currently dominant in processing.

## Why Critical Minerals Matter

### Energy Transition Dependence
Clean energy requires massive mineral inputs:

| Technology | Key Minerals |
|------------|--------------|
| EV batteries | Lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite |
| Wind turbines | Rare earths (neodymium, dysprosium) |
| Solar panels | Silicon, silver, copper |
| Grid storage | Lithium, vanadium |
| Electric motors | Rare earths |

### Demand Explosion
IEA projections (by 2040):
- Lithium: 40x increase
- Cobalt: 20x increase
- Nickel: 20x increase
- Rare earths: 7x increase

### Strategic Importance
- Defense systems require rare earths
- Technology competition depends on access
- Energy security = mineral security
- New "oil" of 21st century?

## Key Minerals

### Lithium
**"White gold"**
- Essential for batteries
- **Producers**: Australia (47%), Chile (30%), China (15%)
- **Processing**: China dominates
- **Issues**: Water use, indigenous rights
- **Trend**: Massive investment, new sources

### Cobalt
**Most problematic**
- Battery cathodes
- **Producers**: DRC (70%)
- **Processing**: China (80%)
- **Issues**: Child labor, conflict, concentration
- **Trend**: Cobalt-free battery R&D

### Rare Earth Elements (REEs)
**17 elements, not actually rare**
- Magnets, catalysts, electronics
- **Mining**: China (60%), Myanmar (3rd largest), Australia
- **Processing**: China (~91% of separation/refining)
- **Heavy REEs** (dysprosium, terbium): ~60% from [[Myanmar Rare Earths|Myanmar's Kachin State]] (per EarthRights, 2025); China sourced ~98% of HREE imports from Myanmar in 2023
- **Issues**: Environmental damage, strategic vulnerability, conflict-zone sourcing
- **Trend**: Lynas (Australia/Malaysia) became first non-Chinese producer of separated heavy rare earths (May 2025); Pentagon invested $400M in MP Materials (July 2025)
- See [[Myanmar Rare Earths]] for detailed analysis

### Nickel
**Battery grade crucial**
- Stainless steel, batteries
- **Producers**: Indonesia (48%), Philippines
- **Processing**: China growing
- **Issues**: Environmental damage (Indonesia)
- **Trend**: Indonesian dominance growing

### Copper
**Electrification backbone**
- Wiring, motors, infrastructure
- **Producers**: Chile, Peru, DRC, China
- **Issues**: Grade decline, long lead times
- **Trend**: Structural deficit predicted

### Graphite
**Battery anodes**
- Natural and synthetic
- **Producers**: China (65%)
- **Processing**: China (>90%)
- **Issues**: Highly concentrated
- **Trend**: Alternative sources developing

## China's Dominance

### Mining
- Rare earths: 60%
- Graphite: 65%
- Growing presence in DRC, Indonesia

### Processing
This is where real control lies:

| Mineral | China Processing Share |
|---------|------------------------|
| Rare earths | 90% |
| Cobalt | 80% |
| Lithium | 60% |
| Graphite | >90% |
| Nickel | Growing |

### Why China Dominates
1. Strategic foresight (1990s investment)
2. Environmental tolerance
3. Lower labor costs
4. State-directed investment
5. Integrated supply chains

### Weaponization Potential
- 2010: Rare earth embargo to Japan
- **April 2025**: China imposed export controls on terbium, dysprosium, and five other REEs; dysprosium prices rose 180% within 60 days (per CSIS)
- **January 2026**: Dual-use export ban to Japan over Taiwan remarks
- Processing chokepoint (91% of global capacity)
- Leverage over energy transition and defense supply chains

## Geopolitical Responses

### United States
- Critical Minerals List (50+ minerals)
- Defense Production Act invocations
- IRA incentives for domestic processing
- Partnerships (Australia, Canada)
- Stockpiling considerations

### European Union
- Critical Raw Materials Act
- Strategic autonomy goal
- Recycling emphasis
- African partnerships
- 10% domestic mining target

### Other Players
- **Australia**: Mining powerhouse, processing investment
- **Canada**: Mining expertise, processing push
- **Indonesia**: Nickel dominance, export restrictions
- **DRC**: Cobalt wealth, governance challenges
- **Chile**: Lithium nationalization debates

## Resource Nationalism

### Trend
Producer countries asserting control:
- Indonesia: Nickel export ban
- Chile: Lithium nationalization debates
- DRC: Mining code revisions
- Mexico: Lithium nationalization

### Implications
- Higher costs
- Less reliable supply
- Political relationships matter
- Processing moves to source?

## Alternative Strategies

### Diversification
- New mining projects
- Multiple suppliers
- Reduce China dependence

### Substitution
- Alternative battery chemistries (sodium-ion)
- Reduced cobalt batteries
- Thrifting (less material per unit)

### Recycling
- Urban mining
- Battery recycling
- Circular economy
- Long-term solution

### Innovation
- New extraction technologies
- Deep-sea mining (controversial)
- Asteroid mining (distant future)

## Environmental Concerns

### Mining Impacts
- Water use (lithium)
- Deforestation (nickel)
- Toxic waste (rare earths)
- Community displacement

### Dilemma
Clean energy requires dirty mining:
- EVs need minerals
- Minerals extraction damages environment
- Processing is polluting
- Trade-off management

### Solutions Attempted
- ESG standards
- Certification schemes
- Recycling emphasis
- Technology improvement

## Investment and Competition

### Capital Requirements
- $1.7 trillion investment needed by 2030 (IEA)
- Long project timelines (7-15 years)
- Uncertain demand signals
- Policy dependent

### Race Underway
- US IRA subsidies
- EU incentives
- Chinese continued investment
- Middle powers positioning

## Key Projects

| Project | Location | Mineral | Status |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|
| Thacker Pass | US (Nevada) | Lithium | Contested |
| Mt. Weld | Australia | Rare earths | Operating (Lynas) |
| Lynas Malaysia | Malaysia | Heavy rare earths | Operating (first non-Chinese HREE, May 2025) |

| Kamoa-Kakula | DRC | Copper | Operating |
| MP Materials | US (California) | Rare earths | Operating (Pentagon $400M investment, July 2025) |
| Eneabba | Australia | Rare earths | Commissioning 2026 (Iluka, A$1.25B govt loan) |
| Tanbreez | Greenland | Rare earths | Developing (Critical Metals Corp, US ExIm interest) |
| Kvanefjeld | Greenland | Rare earths | Stalled (uranium mining ban) |

## Future Outlook
