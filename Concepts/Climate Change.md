# Climate Change (Geopolitical Dimensions)

## Definition
Long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities since industrialization. Beyond environmental impact, climate change is reshaping geopolitics through resource competition, migration, conflict, and the politics of energy transition.

## Security Implications

### Threat Multiplier
- Exacerbates existing conflicts
- Resource scarcity
- Food/water insecurity
- Migration pressures
- State fragility

### Direct Impacts
- Sea level rise (coastal states)
- Extreme weather (disasters)
- Agricultural disruption
- Water stress
- Infrastructure damage

## Climate Conflict Nexus

### Vulnerable Regions
- **Sahel**: Desertification, herder-farmer conflicts
- **Middle East**: Water scarcity
- **South Asia**: Glacier melt, flooding
- **Pacific Islands**: Existential threat
- **Arctic**: Resource competition

### Causal Pathways
```
Climate stress → Resource scarcity → Competition
     → Migration → Tension → Conflict
```

## Geopolitics of Transition

### Winners
- Critical mineral holders
- Renewable technology leaders
- Low-carbon exporters
- Nuclear energy states

### Losers
- Petrostates (stranded assets)
- Coal-dependent economies
- Climate-vulnerable nations
- Slow adapters

### Great Power Dynamics
- US-China technology race
- EU green leadership aspirations
- Russia's carbon economy
- India's development-climate balance

## Key Actors & Positions

### Major Emitters
| Country | Share of Global Emissions | Position |
|---------|---------------------------|----------|
| China | ~30% | Peak by 2030, net-zero 2060 |
| United States | ~14% | Inconsistent commitment |
| EU | ~8% | Climate leader (self-image) |
| India | ~7% | Development priority |
| Russia | ~5% | Minimal commitment |

### Vulnerable States
- Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
- Least Developed Countries (LDCs)
- Climate justice demands
- Loss and damage claims

## International Framework

### Paris Agreement (2015)
- Limit warming to 1.5-2°C
- Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
- Five-year review cycles
- No enforcement mechanism

### COP Process
- Annual negotiations
- Increasing attention
- Implementation gaps
- Financing debates

### Key Issues
- **Mitigation**: Emissions reductions
- **Adaptation**: Adjusting to impacts
- **Finance**: $100B+ annually pledged
- **Loss and damage**: Compensation debates

## Critical Minerals Geopolitics

### Energy Transition Minerals
- Lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper
- Rare earths
- Essential for batteries, renewables

### Concentration Risks
- China dominates processing
- DRC cobalt concerns
- Supply chain vulnerability
- New resource competition

## Arctic Transformation

### Changes
- Ice melt accelerating
- New shipping routes
- Resource access
- Military significance

### Competition
- Russia (dominant Arctic state)
- China ("near-Arctic state" claim)
- US renewed attention
- Nordic states
- Arctic Council tensions

## Climate Migration

### Projections
- 200M+ climate migrants by 2050
- Internal displacement primary
- Cross-border implications
- Security concern framing

### Hotspots
- Bangladesh (sea level rise)
- Sub-Saharan Africa (desertification)
- Central America (drought)
- Pacific Islands (existential)

## Policy Debates

### Climate vs. Development
- Global South priorities
- Historical emissions responsibility
- "Common but differentiated responsibilities"
- Just transition

### Security Integration
- Climate as security threat
- Military planning
- Intelligence assessments
- NATO, Pentagon recognition
