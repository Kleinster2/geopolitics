# Liberalism

## Definition
IR theory emphasizing cooperation, institutions, and interdependence as paths to peace. Unlike [[Realism]], sees potential for progress beyond power politics through democracy, trade, and international organizations.

## Key Thinkers
- Immanuel Kant
- Woodrow Wilson
- Robert Keohane
- Joseph Nye
- Michael Doyle

## Core Principles
1. **Multiple actors**: States, IOs, NGOs, individuals all matter
2. **Cooperation is possible**: Mutual gains through institutions
3. **Interdependence constrains conflict**: Economic ties raise costs of war
4. **Domestic politics matter**: Regime type affects foreign policy
5. **Ideas and norms shape behavior**: Not just material power

## Variants

### Democratic Peace Theory (Doyle)
Democracies rarely fight each other due to shared norms and institutional constraints.

### Commercial Liberalism
Economic interdependence creates incentives for peace.

### Neoliberal Institutionalism (Keohane)
International institutions facilitate cooperation by reducing transaction costs and uncertainty.

### Republican Liberalism
Domestic political structures shape state preferences and behavior.

## Key Mechanisms
- **Institutions**: UN, WTO, EU reduce uncertainty
- **Trade**: Creates mutual dependence and peace incentives
- **Democracy**: Accountability constrains war-making
- **Norms**: Human rights, sovereignty, multilateralism

## Critiques
- Overly optimistic about cooperation
- Cannot explain democratic aggression toward non-democracies
- Economic interdependence didn't prevent WWI
- Western-centric assumptions
