# Splinternet

## Definition

The fragmentation of the global internet into distinct, nationally or regionally controlled networks with different content, standards, and governance. Not a binary split but an ongoing process of divergence along geopolitical lines.

## Origin

Term coined by Clyde Wayne Crews Jr. (Cato Institute, April 2001), originally in a *positive* sense - arguing for proprietary parallel networks as alternatives to over-regulation. Later repurposed pejoratively by writers like Scott Malcomson (New America) to describe the political fragmentation of the global internet.

Related precursor: "cyberbalkanization" (Cass Sunstein, *Republic.com*, 2001) - focused on ideological fragmentation of online discourse rather than infrastructure.

## Mechanisms of Fragmentation

### Technical
- **Filtering**: Deep packet inspection, DNS blocking (China, Iran, Russia)
- **National intranets**: Iran's dual-internet system, North Korea's Kwangmyong
- **Throttling**: Russia's "16 KB Curtain" - renders services unusable while appearing connected
- **Data localization**: Requiring data storage within borders

### Legal/Regulatory
- **Content laws**: Different speech standards per jurisdiction
- **Data protection**: GDPR (EU), PIPL (China), varying requirements
- **Platform bans**: TikTok in US, Google in China, Telegram in various countries
- **Licensing requirements**: Platform operation permits

### Commercial
- **App store restrictions**: Government-mandated removals
- **Payment system fragmentation**: SWIFT alternatives (CIPS, SPFS)
- **Standards divergence**: Competing 5G/6G standards

### Infrastructure
- **Submarine cable routing**: Avoiding adversary territory
- **Satellite constellations**: Starlink vs. national systems
- **DNS alternatives**: National root servers

## Current State (2025-2026)

A 2026 CircleID analysis describes what is emerging as "not a binary splinternet, but a layered governance environment" - fragmentation at some layers (content, regulation) while maintaining interoperability at others (protocols, routing).

### China: Most Developed Alternative
- Great Firewall operational since early 2000s
- Domestic platform ecosystem (WeChat, Alibaba, Baidu)
- Separate app stores, payment systems
- BeiDou navigation vs. GPS

### Russia: Accelerating Isolation
- 57 internet shutdowns in 2025 (world's highest)
- 37,166 hours of disruption, ~$11.9B economic damage
- Sovereign Internet Law enabling disconnect capability
- Moving toward Iran-style dual model

### Iran: Dual System
- National intranet (SHOMA/National Information Network)
- Filtered global access (heavy censorship)
- During June 2025 conflict with Israel: maintained domestic internet while cutting global access
- Announced national AI platform designed to function offline

## Economic Costs

- Internet shutdowns cost $19.7B globally in 2025 (156% increase from 2024)
- Network effects lost when markets fragment
- Compliance costs for companies operating across regimes
- Innovation loss from reduced knowledge flows

## Arguments For

- National security (prevent foreign surveillance/interference)
- Cultural sovereignty (protect local norms)
- Infant industry protection (domestic tech development)
- Data protection (citizen privacy from foreign firms)

## Arguments Against

- Destroys network effects that make internet valuable
- Enables authoritarian control of information
- Raises costs for businesses and consumers
- Reduces innovation through knowledge isolation
- Often deployed for repression, not protection

## Critiques

The "splinternet" frame may overstate fragmentation:
- Deep technical layer (TCP/IP, BGP) remains unified
- Commercial incentives push toward interoperability
- Full disconnection is economically devastating
- Most fragmentation is at content/application layer, not infrastructure
