# Donroe Doctrine

## Overview
Portmanteau of "Donald" + "Monroe" describing Trump's 2026 revival and aggressive expansion of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. Coined by the New York Post, later adopted by Trump himself. Ranked #3 in Eurasia Group's Top Risks of 2026. Represents shift from rules-based order to spheres of influence.

## Origin of Term

### The New York Post Cover
- NY Post (Murdoch-owned, pro-Trump) published cover with Trump holding pointer
- Map of North America redrawn in red Sharpie
- Headline: "The Donroe Doctrine"
- Style mimicked Trump's famous Sharpie edits

### Trump's Adoption
After the Venezuela raid, Trump embraced it:
> "They now call it the 'Donroe Doctrine'"

State Department doubled down on X:
> "This is OUR Hemisphere, and President Trump will not allow our security to be threatened."

## Key Elements

### Beyond Monroe
Where 19th-century Monroe Doctrine warned external powers away, Donroe Doctrine:
- **Actively asserts** American primacy (not just defensive)
- Uses military pressure, economic coercion
- Personal score-settling mixed with policy
- Extends to territories (Greenland, Panama Canal, Canada)

### Components
| Target | Method |
|--------|--------|
| **Venezuela** | Military capture of Maduro |
| **Greenland** | Annexation threats to NATO ally |
| **Panama Canal** | Demands for control |
| **Canada** | "51st state" rhetoric |
| **Gulf of Mexico** | Renamed "Gulf of America" |

### Underlying Logic
- Spheres of influence over rules-based order
- Strong countries entitled to dominate neighbors
- International law subordinate to national interest
- US comfort with unilateral military action

## Eurasia Group: Top Risk #3 (2026)

[[Ian Bremmer]]'s [[Eurasia Group]] ranked Donroe Doctrine among top global risks in [[Eurasia Group Top Risks 2026]]:

### Why It's a Top Risk
- Signals unpredictable US foreign policy
- Opens door to other powers claiming spheres
- Russia, China can cite precedent
- Undermines alliance credibility

### Trump 2.0 vs. Trump 1.0
The report notes crucial differences from first term:
- **Trump 1.0**: Threatened tariffs on Mexico, talked about buying Greenland
- **Trump 2.0**: Actually captured Maduro, threatens military force against NATO ally
- Pattern: Threats now backed by action
- Domestic political environment more permissive

### What Makes This Different
- Not just rhetoric - operational military action
- Targets include **allies** (Denmark/Greenland, Canada)
- Blends personal grievance with strategic policy
- "FAFO" (fuck around and find out) approach to foreign policy

## International Reactions

### European Concerns
From ECFR analysis:
- Highlights volatility of Trump foreign policy
- Comfort with military solutions
- Less predictable, more unilateral US
- Implications from Greenland to Ukraine to Taiwan

### Criticism
- "Rogue superpower" era
- "Putinisation" of US foreign policy
- Subordinates international law to power
- Entitles great powers to spheres of influence

### Latin American Response
- Verbal condemnation but no action
- Regional institutions impotent
- Accommodation likely path
- [[Brazil]] exposed as unable to respond

### Brazilian Analysis (WW Especial Panel, January 2026)

**Intervention model comparison (Felipe Loureiro, USP):** Venezuela intervention was "low-cost" compared to Iraq/Afghanistan—surgical removal of head of state, no ground commitment, regime left in place to maintain stability. Unlike Iraq 2003 (where Bush dismantled Ba'athist state apparatus), Trump uses existing chavista structure to extract resources. Avoids nation-building costs while demonstrating dominance.

**China/Russia response (Roberto Dumas, Insper):** Both issued protests but took no meaningful action. Venezuela represents lost influence for both, but neither treats it as core interest—China focused on Pacific Rim/Taiwan, Russia on Ukraine.

## Connection to Other Concepts

### [[Predatory Hegemony]]
[[Stephen Walt]]'s term captures the extractive nature - applying predation to allies and neighbors, not just adversaries.

### [[Spheres of Influence]]
Donroe Doctrine explicitly legitimizes great power spheres - with implications for Russian and Chinese claims.

### [[Gunboat Diplomacy]]
Military force as primary tool, not last resort. Venezuela raid as template.

### [[Melian Dialogue]]
"The strong do what they will" made explicit US policy.

## Implications

### For Latin America
- End of "non-intervention" norm
- US veto on foreign partnerships
- China/Russia engagement constrained
- Return to "backyard" status

### For Global Order
- Precedent for sphere-grabbing
- Rules-based system further eroded
- Other powers emboldened
- Alliance credibility damaged

### For US
- Short-term dominance
- Long-term legitimacy costs
- Overextension risks
- Resistance will grow
