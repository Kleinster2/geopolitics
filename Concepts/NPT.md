# Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)

## Overview
The cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime. Signed 1968, entered force 1970. Near-universal membership (191 parties) makes it one of the most widely adhered treaties in history. Facing increasing strain as great power competition intensifies and nuclear modernization accelerates.

## Three Pillars

### 1. Non-Proliferation
- Non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS) commit not to acquire nuclear weapons
- Nuclear weapon states (NWS) commit not to transfer weapons or assist acquisition
- Defines NWS as states that tested before January 1, 1967 (US, Russia, UK, France, China)

### 2. Disarmament
- Article VI: NWS commit to pursue negotiations toward nuclear disarmament
- "General and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control"
- Most contentious pillar - NNWS argue NWS have not fulfilled commitment

### 3. Peaceful Use
- All parties have "inalienable right" to peaceful nuclear energy
- Technology sharing for civilian purposes
- Subject to IAEA safeguards

## Key Provisions

| Article | Content |
|---------|---------|
| I | NWS shall not transfer nuclear weapons |
| II | NNWS shall not receive or manufacture |
| III | NNWS accept IAEA safeguards |
| IV | Right to peaceful nuclear energy |
| V | Peaceful nuclear explosions (obsolete) |
| VI | Pursue disarmament negotiations |
| X | Withdrawal with 3 months notice |

## Non-Parties

| State | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| India | Never signed | Tested 1974, 1998 |
| Pakistan | Never signed | Tested 1998 |
| Israel | Never signed | Undeclared arsenal (~90 weapons) |
| North Korea | Withdrew 2003 | Only state to withdraw |
| South Sudan | Never signed | Newest state |

## Review Process

### Review Conferences
- Every 5 years
- Assess implementation
- Often contentious
- 2015 conference: Failed to adopt outcome
- 2020 conference: Delayed by COVID, held 2022, no consensus

### Preparatory Committees
- Meet in years between reviews
- Build toward consensus
- Increasingly polarized

## Tensions and Strains

### Disarmament Gap
NNWS frustration that NWS:
- Modernizing rather than reducing arsenals
- No timeline for elimination
- Article VI seen as unfulfilled promise

This frustration drove the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW, 2017), which NWS reject.

### Discrimination Critique
- Permanent two-tier system
- NWS keep weapons indefinitely
- NNWS barred forever
- India/Pakistan outside system but tolerated

### Withdrawal Problem
- North Korea precedent (2003)
- Article X allows withdrawal
- No consequences mechanism
- Iran withdrawal threat

### Verification Challenges
- IAEA resources limited
- Additional Protocol not universal
- Iran, North Korea exposed gaps
- Undeclared activities hard to detect

## NPT and Current Crises

### Iran
- NPT member since 1970
- IAEA found violations (2003)
- JCPOA attempted to resolve
- Now near threshold capability while technically in NPT

### North Korea
- Withdrew 2003
- No mechanism to prevent
- Now accepted as nuclear state?
- NPT failure case

## The Bargain Under Stress

The NPT rests on a bargain:
1. NNWS give up weapons option
2. NWS pursue disarmament
3. All get peaceful technology

As of 2026:
- NWS modernizing, not disarming
- New START suspended
- Arms control collapsing
- Bargain increasingly questioned
