# Sanctions

## Definition
Economic penalties imposed by one or more countries on a target (state, entity, or individual) to coerce behavior change, punish actions, or signal disapproval. A tool between diplomacy and war.

## Types of Sanctions

### By Target
- **Comprehensive**: Entire economy (Cuba, North Korea)
- **Targeted/Smart**: Specific individuals, entities, sectors
- **Secondary**: Penalize third parties dealing with target

### By Mechanism
- **Trade sanctions**: Export/import bans
- **Financial sanctions**: Asset freezes, banking restrictions
- **Travel bans**: Visa denials
- **Arms embargoes**: Weapons restrictions
- **Sectoral**: Target specific industries (energy, finance)

## Key Actors

### United States
- Most powerful sanctions regime
- Dollar dominance enables financial sanctions
- OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) enforcement
- Secondary sanctions leverage

### European Union
- Coordinated sanctions regime
- Human rights focus
- Less extraterritorial reach than US

### United Nations
- Security Council sanctions (binding)
- Requires P5 consensus
- Often watered down

## Effectiveness Debate

### Arguments For
- Cheaper than military action
- Signals resolve
- Can impose costs
- Targeted sanctions reduce humanitarian impact

### Arguments Against
- Rarely change behavior on core interests
- Humanitarian costs (comprehensive)
- Rally-round-flag effect
- Evasion and adaptation
- Third parties benefit

### Research Findings (Hufbauer et al.)
- ~30% "success" rate historically
- More effective for modest goals
- Multilateral better than unilateral
- Decline over time (adaptation)

## Major Sanctions Cases

| Target | Duration | Result |
|--------|----------|--------|
| South Africa | 1960s-1990s | Contributed to apartheid end |
| Iran | 2006-present | Nuclear delays, no capitulation |
| Russia (2014-) | 2014-present | Costs imposed, no policy change |
| North Korea | 1950s-present | Nuclear program continued |
| Cuba | 1962-present | Regime persists |

## Russia Sanctions (Post-2022)
- Most comprehensive ever on major economy
- SWIFT exclusion (partial)
- Central bank asset freeze
- Energy sanctions (phased)
- Export controls (technology)
- Results: Economic damage, adaptation, no war end

## Humanitarian Concerns
- Comprehensive sanctions harm civilians
- Medical/food exemptions needed
- "Smart sanctions" response
- Ethical debates continue

## Sanctions Evasion
- Ship-to-ship transfers
- Shell companies
- Cryptocurrency
- Third-country transshipment
