# Food Security

## Overview
The ability of people to access sufficient, safe, nutritious food. Increasingly a geopolitical issue as climate change, conflict, and great power competition threaten global food systems. The Ukraine war demonstrated food's weaponization potential.

## Dimensions of Food Security

### Four Pillars (FAO)
1. **Availability**: Sufficient food produced/imported
2. **Access**: Economic and physical access
3. **Utilization**: Nutritional value, safety
4. **Stability**: Consistent over time

### Food Security vs. Food Sovereignty
- **Security**: Access to food (any source)
- **Sovereignty**: Control over food system (domestic production emphasis)

## Why Food is Geopolitical

### Strategic Resource
- Populations need food
- Food shortages → instability
- Exporters have leverage
- Importers are vulnerable

### Historical Pattern
- Food crises → revolutions (Arab Spring)
- Weaponized throughout history
- Blockades and sieges
- Famine as tool

### Current Tensions
- Climate change disruption
- Population growth
- Water stress
- Supply chain concentration

## Global Food System

### Major Exporters

| Product | Top Exporters |
|---------|---------------|
| Wheat | Russia, US, Canada, France, Ukraine |
| Rice | India, Thailand, Vietnam |
| Corn | US, Brazil, Argentina |
| Soybeans | Brazil, US, Argentina |
| Vegetable oils | Indonesia, Malaysia (palm) |

### Major Importers
- Middle East/North Africa (most dependent)
- Sub-Saharan Africa
- East Asia
- Egypt, Turkey, Bangladesh largest wheat importers

### Concentration Risks
- Few exporters, many importers
- Chokepoints (Suez, Black Sea)
- Climate zones vulnerable
- Fertilizer concentration

## Ukraine War Impact

### "World's Breadbasket"
- Ukraine: 10% global wheat exports
- Russia: 20% global wheat exports
- Together: Major sunflower oil, corn

### Disruptions
- Black Sea blockade (2022)
- Grain deal negotiations
- Price spikes (40%+ increases)
- Export restrictions spread
- Fertilizer shortages

### Vulnerable Countries
- Egypt: 80% wheat from Russia/Ukraine
- Lebanon, Tunisia, Libya
- Sub-Saharan Africa
- Middle East broadly

### Weaponization
- Russia used food as leverage
- Grain deal as bargaining chip
- Export restrictions as weapon
- Global South resentment

## Climate Change Threats

### Production Risks
- Changing rainfall patterns
- Extreme heat events
- Droughts (more frequent)
- Floods
- Pest/disease spread

### Vulnerable Regions
- Sub-Saharan Africa
- South Asia
- Mediterranean
- Central America
- Australia (variable)

### Projections
- 2-6% yield decline per degree
- Increased volatility
- Geographic shifts
- Water stress compounding

## Water-Food Nexus

### Agriculture's Share
- 70% of global freshwater use
- Irrigation critical for yields
- Groundwater depletion
- Transboundary rivers

### Hotspots
- Nile Basin (Egypt-Ethiopia)
- Indus Basin (India-Pakistan)
- Mekong (China-Southeast Asia)
- Colorado River (US-Mexico)

## Fertilizer Geopolitics

### Critical Inputs
| Nutrient | Key Producers |
|----------|---------------|
| Nitrogen | Russia, China, US |
| Phosphate | China, Morocco, US |
| Potash | Russia, Belarus, Canada |

### Russia/Belarus Dominance
- 40% of global potash (combined)
- Sanctions complications
- Supply disruptions
- Price spikes

### Implications
- Fertilizer = yields
- No fertilizer = famine risk
- Developing world most vulnerable
- Food inflation driver

## Food as Weapon

### Historical Examples
- Blockades (WWI, WWII)
- Holodomor (Soviet Ukraine)
- Bengal famine
- North Korea food control

### Modern Forms
- Export restrictions
- Market manipulation
- Sanctions complications
- Infrastructure targeting

### Russia's Use
- Grain deal leverage
- Fertilizer exports
- Black Sea control
- Global South outreach

## Regional Food Security

### Middle East/North Africa
- Most import-dependent region
- Water scarce
- Population growing
- Subsidy systems strained
- Instability risk high

### Sub-Saharan Africa
- Production potential
- Infrastructure gaps
- Climate vulnerable
- Conflict zones
- Fastest population growth

### South Asia
- Self-sufficient (mostly)
- Climate risks rising
- Groundwater depletion
- Large populations

### China
- Import dependent (soybeans especially)
- Stockpiling
- Overseas agricultural investment
- Food security priority

## Strategic Responses

### Stockpiling
- Strategic reserves
- China holds 50%+ of global stocks
- Buffer against shocks

### Diversification
- Multiple suppliers
- Trade agreements
- Reduce dependencies

### Domestic Production
- Agricultural investment
- Technology adoption
- Irrigation expansion
- Food sovereignty push

### Trade Policy
- Export restrictions (problematic)
- Import diversification
- Bilateral deals

## Technology and Future

### Innovations
- Drought-resistant crops
- Precision agriculture
- Vertical farming
- Alternative proteins
- GMOs (contested)

### Limits
- Technology ≠ access
- Climate overwhelms adaptation?
- Water constraints remain
- Distribution challenges

## Instability Link

### Pattern
```
Food price spike
       ↓
Living standard collapse
       ↓
Political grievances
       ↓
Protests/unrest
       ↓
Regime change or repression
```

### Examples
- 2008: Food riots in 30+ countries
- 2011: Arab Spring (bread prices)
- 2022: Sri Lanka collapse
