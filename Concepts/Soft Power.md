# Soft Power

## Definition
The ability to shape preferences of others through attraction rather than coercion or payment. Getting others to *want* what you want through appeal of culture, values, and policies.

## Key Thinkers
- Joseph Nye (coined term, 1990)

## Core Principles
1. **Attraction over coercion**: Influence through appeal, not force
2. **Three sources**: Culture, political values, foreign policy
3. **Legitimacy**: Soft power depends on perceived legitimacy
4. **Long-term investment**: Built over time, easily damaged
