# Constructivism

## Definition
IR theory emphasizing that international politics is shaped by shared ideas, norms, and identities rather than just material factors. The world is "socially constructed" - structures and actors mutually constitute each other through interaction.

## Key Thinkers
- Alexander Wendt
- Nicholas Onuf (coined term)
- Martha Finnemore
- Peter Katzenstein
- Emanuel Adler

## Core Principles
1. **Ideas matter**: Norms, identities, culture shape behavior
2. **Intersubjectivity**: Shared understandings constitute reality
3. **Mutual constitution**: Agents and structures shape each other
4. **Social construction**: Interests aren't given, they're constructed
5. **Change is possible**: Ideas can transform international politics

## Key Concepts

### Anarchy is What States Make of It (Wendt)
- Anarchy doesn't have inherent logic
- States' interactions create meaning
- Enemies vs. friends is socially constructed
- US-Canada vs. US-North Korea (same anarchy, different relationships)

### Norms
- Standards of appropriate behavior
- Shape what states want (not just what they can do)
- Examples: sovereignty, human rights, non-intervention

### Identity
- How actors see themselves and others
- Shapes interests and behavior
- National identity affects foreign policy
- "Who we are" determines "what we want"

### Socialization
- States learn appropriate behavior
- International institutions as teachers
- Norm internalization over time

## Comparison with Other Theories

| Aspect | Realism | Liberalism | Constructivism |
|--------|---------|------------|----------------|
| Key factor | Power | Institutions | Ideas/norms |
| Interests | Fixed (survival) | Material | Constructed |
| Change | Difficult | Incremental | Possible |
| Focus | Material | Material + institutions | Ideational |

## Explanatory Power

### What Constructivism Explains Well
- Norm change (slavery abolition, decolonization)
- Identity-driven conflicts
- Soft power effectiveness
- Why similar states behave differently
- European integration depth

### Weaknesses
- Hard to operationalize/test
- "Everything matters" criticism
- Difficulty explaining power politics
- When do ideas trump interests?
- Post-hoc explanations

## Applications

### Security Communities (Adler & Barnett)
- Groups where war becomes unthinkable
- Shared identity, values, trust
- Example: NATO, EU, US-Canada

### Norm Entrepreneurs
- Actors who promote new norms
- NGOs, states, individuals
- Example: Anti-landmine campaign, R2P

### Strategic Culture
- National security thinking shaped by history
- Japan's pacifism, German restraint
- American exceptionalism

## Contemporary Relevance

### Identity Conflicts
- Nationalism resurgence
- Civilizational framings
- "Clash of civilizations" narratives

### Norm Contestation
- Sovereignty vs. intervention
- Human rights universality debates
- Democratic vs. authoritarian norms

### Institutional Identities
- NATO's purpose post-Cold War
- EU identity and purpose
- UN relevance debates
