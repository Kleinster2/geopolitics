# Sovereignty

## Overview
The principle that states have supreme authority within their territory and are legally equal in the international system. The foundation of the modern state system, though increasingly challenged by globalization, human rights norms, and transnational threats.

## Definition

### Internal Sovereignty
- Supreme authority within territory
- Monopoly on legitimate violence
- Control over laws, people, resources
- No higher domestic authority

### External Sovereignty
- Independence from outside authority
- Legal equality with other states
- Non-interference right
- Recognition by other states

### Juridical vs. Empirical
- **Juridical**: Legal recognition (even weak states have)
- **Empirical**: Actual control (varies greatly)
- Somalia has juridical sovereignty but limited empirical sovereignty

## Core Principles

### Westphalian Norms (1648)
1. **Territorial integrity**: Borders are sacrosanct
2. **Non-intervention**: No interference in internal affairs
3. **Legal equality**: All states equal regardless of size
4. **Self-determination**: Peoples choose their government

### UN Charter Codification
- Article 2(1): Sovereign equality
- Article 2(4): No use of force against territorial integrity
- Article 2(7): Non-intervention in domestic jurisdiction

## Sovereignty and Anarchy

### Relationship
```
Sovereignty (supreme internal authority)
         +
Anarchy (no external authority above states)
         =
Modern State System
```

- Sovereignty creates the units
- Anarchy describes their relationship
- Together = Westphalian order

## Challenges to Sovereignty

### Human Rights
- Universal rights vs. state prerogatives
- Humanitarian intervention debates
- R2P (Responsibility to Protect)
- "Sovereignty as responsibility"

### Globalization
- Economic interdependence
- Capital mobility
- Information flows
- Transnational actors

### International Institutions
- WTO rules constrain policy
- EU supranational governance
- ICC jurisdiction over individuals
- Treaty obligations

### Transnational Threats
- Terrorism
- Climate change
- Pandemics
- Cyber attacks

### Great Power Politics
- Spheres of influence
- Intervention despite norms
- "Rules for thee, not for me"
- Ukraine, Iraq examples

## Responsibility to Protect (R2P)

### Concept (2005)
When states fail to protect citizens from:
- Genocide
- War crimes
- Ethnic cleansing
- Crimes against humanity

International community can intervene.

### Pillars
1. State responsibility to protect own population
2. International assistance to build capacity
3. International intervention as last resort

### Controversies
- Libya 2011 (mission creep)
- Syria (no intervention)
- Selective application
- Abuse potential

## Sovereignty Debates

### Absolutist View
- Sovereignty is indivisible
- Non-interference is paramount
- Internal affairs are internal
- Held by: Russia, China, many Global South states

### Conditional View
- Sovereignty carries responsibilities
- Gross abuses forfeit protection
- International community can act
- Held by: Many Western states (selectively)

### Post-Sovereign View
- Sovereignty is eroding
- Globalization transforms statehood
- New forms of governance emerging
- Academic argument (contested)

## Sovereignty in Practice

### Strong Sovereignty States
- United States (resists international constraints)
- China (absolute non-interference rhetoric)
- Russia (defends principle, violates it)

### Pooled Sovereignty
- European Union members
- Voluntarily share authority
- Still sovereign in theory

### Compromised Sovereignty
- Failed states
- Occupied territories
- Protectorates
- Client states

## Recognition Politics

### Criteria for Statehood (Montevideo 1933)
1. Permanent population
2. Defined territory
3. Government
4. Capacity for relations with other states

### Recognition Debates
- Taiwan (de facto state, limited recognition)
- Kosovo (contested)
- Palestine (partial recognition)
- Somaliland (no recognition)

### Politics of Recognition
- Great powers as gatekeepers
- UN membership as validation
- Recognition ≠ approval

## Sovereignty vs. Human Rights

### Tension
| Sovereignty | Human Rights |
|-------------|--------------|
| Non-interference | Universal protection |
| State authority | Individual rights |
| Pluralism | Universal norms |
| Order | Justice |

### Resolution Attempts
- R2P framework
- International criminal law
- UN Human Rights Council
- Treaty-based monitoring
