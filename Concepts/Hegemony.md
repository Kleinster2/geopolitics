# Hegemony

## Definition
Preponderant power or dominance by one state over others in the international system. A hegemon shapes rules, norms, and institutions, providing public goods (or extracting benefits) from its position.

## Key Thinkers
- Robert Gilpin
- Robert Keohane
- John Mearsheimer
- G. John Ikenberry

## Types of Hegemony

### By Scope
- **Global hegemony**: Dominance worldwide (US post-1991)
- **Regional hegemony**: Dominance in a region (US in Western Hemisphere)

### By Nature
- **Coercive hegemony**: Maintained through force/threat
- **Consensual hegemony**: Maintained through legitimacy and benefits
- **Benevolent hegemony**: Provides public goods, self-restraint

## Hegemonic Stability Theory (Gilpin, Kindleberger)

A stable international economic order requires a hegemon to:
1. Provide public goods (open markets, stable currency)
2. Enforce rules
3. Act as lender of last resort
4. Absorb costs of system maintenance

**Without hegemon**: Instability, protectionism, conflict (1930s)

## American Hegemony

### Foundations
- Military: Global reach, alliance networks
- Economic: Dollar dominance, market access
- Institutional: UN, IMF, World Bank, NATO
- Ideological: Democracy, free markets

### Characteristics
- "Liberal hegemony" - rule-based order
- Self-binding through institutions
- Alliance-based (not purely coercive)
- Legitimacy through benefits

### Debates
- Declining hegemony? (overstretch, challengers)
- Hegemony vs. empire
- Costs vs. benefits
- Sustainability

## Chinese Hegemony?

### Regional Ambitions
- Mearsheimer: States seek regional hegemony
- China as Asian hegemon?
- "Monroe Doctrine with Chinese characteristics"

### Global Contestation
- Alternative institutions (AIIB, BRI)
- Technology standards
- Currency internationalization
- Ideological model?

## Hegemonic Transition

### Power Transition Theory (Organski)
- Rising challenger approaches hegemon
- Dangerous period: dissatisfied challenger
- War or peaceful transition

### Historical Cases
| Transition | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| Spain → Netherlands | Conflict |
| Netherlands → Britain | Peaceful |
| Britain → US | Peaceful |
| US → China? | TBD |

## Critiques
