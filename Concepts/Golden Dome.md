# Golden Dome

## Overview
Official US missile defense program to protect the continental United States from Russian and Chinese ballistic missiles. Initiated by executive order January 27, 2025 (originally "Iron Dome for America," renamed May 2025). Part of broader shift toward homeland defense and away from arms control frameworks.

## Program Status

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Legal basis | Executive order, January 27, 2025 |
| Program lead | Gen. Michael Guetlein |
| Timeline | Pentagon expects "demonstration under ideal conditions" by end of 2028 |
| Cost estimates | $175B (White House) to $831B (CBO) to $3.6T (AEI) |

## Concept

### What's Being Built
- Missile defense installations in Arctic region
- Protection against attacks from both Russia and China
- Extends existing missile defense architecture northward
- Name evokes Israel's Iron Dome but at continental scale
- Requires "defenses that are both scalable and affordable, including new directed-energy and other non-kinetic technologies" (Gen. Guetlein)

### Strategic Logic
- Arctic is shortest flight path for ICBMs from Russia/China to US
- Current US missile defense (Ground-based Midcourse Defense) limited
- Addresses perceived vulnerability to growing threats
- Alternative to arms control: defense rather than mutual restraint

## Greenland Connection

**January 14, 2026**: Trump claimed it was "vital" for US to control Greenland to construct Golden Dome.

**January 22, 2026**: Framework agreement with NATO allies includes "a piece of" Golden Dome being situated on Greenland.

**Expert pushback**: Todd Harrison (AEI) called this "detached from reality" - US already has presence in Greenland since 1951 under existing Denmark agreement. Pituffik Space Base already does missile warning and space surveillance.

**Denmark response**: PM Mette Frederiksen welcomed talks "provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity."

**Strategic resource**: Tanbreez deposit in Greenland provides rare-earth elements relevant to hypersonic capabilities.

## Funding and Oversight (2025-2026)

### Budget
- **$24.4 billion** from One Big Beautiful Bill Act (2025)
- **$13 billion** additional FY2026 allocation
- Total initial cost estimates exceed **$500 billion**

### Congressional Oversight (Late January 2026)
Lawmakers demanded the Pentagon produce master deployment schedule, cost schedule, performance metrics, and finalized system architecture. Members reported receiving none of these. Congress directed DoD to convert approved funding into detailed budget and architecture plan.

### Russia's Response (February 3, 2026)
Deputy FM Ryabkov warned Russia would take "military and technical compensatory measures" if US deploys Golden Dome elements to Greenland. Timed two days before [[New START Expiration|New START's expiration]].

### Expert Pushback (February 2026)
- **Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists**: "Trump doesn't need the Golden Dome in Greenland. He needs a stronger NATO"
- **Defense One**: Experts call Trump's Golden Dome rationale for Greenland "detached from reality"
- **The National Interest**: "Why the Golden Dome Doesn't Need Greenland"
- Treasury Secretary Bessent explicitly stated Trump "believes that Greenland is essential for the Golden Dome Missile Shield"

## Context

### Arms Control Collapse
Golden Dome emerges as arms control framework dies:
- [[New START Expiration]] (February 2026)
- [[INF Treaty]] collapsed (2019)
- [[Open Skies Treaty]] withdrawn (2020)
- No successor negotiations

### Security Dilemma
Per Lourival Sant'Anna (CNN Brasil, February 2026): If US achieves effective missile defense, Russia and China perceive this as threatening their deterrent. They would feel compelled to build more weapons to overcome defenses - classic security dilemma dynamic.

This is exactly what Kissinger analyzed: increasing your security decreases others' security.

## Technical Challenges

### Scale Problem
- Continental US is vastly larger than Israel
- ICBMs travel at ~7 km/second
- Hypersonic weapons designed to evade defenses
- No proven countermeasures for Russian hypersonic systems

### Cost
- Ground-based Midcourse Defense already costs billions
- Arctic infrastructure extremely expensive
- Maintenance in polar conditions difficult
- Opportunity cost vs. other defense priorities

### Effectiveness Debate
- Missile defense has mixed test record
- Adversaries can build more warheads cheaper than US can build interceptors
- Decoys and countermeasures complicate interception
- Critics: Creates false sense of security

## Strategic Implications

### For Arms Control
- Signals US prefers defense over negotiated limits
- Russia/China see as destabilizing
- ABM Treaty withdrawal (2002) already removed constraints
- Further reduces incentive for adversary restraint

### For Deterrence
- If US believes it's protected, does it take more risks?
- Does it undermine mutual assured destruction logic?
- Extended deterrence implications for allies

### For Russia/China
- Incentive to build more warheads
- Develop penetration technologies
- Hypersonic weapons partly response to missile defense
- Arms race acceleration

## Historical Parallel

### Reagan's SDI ("Star Wars")
- 1983 proposal for space-based missile defense
- Never deployed but influenced Soviet calculations
- Contributed to arms race pressure
- Eventually abandoned for arms control approach

Golden Dome represents return to defense-first thinking after decades of arms control emphasis.
