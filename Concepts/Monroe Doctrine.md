# Monroe Doctrine

## Overview
1823 US policy declaring the Western Hemisphere closed to European colonization and intervention. Evolved into justification for US regional hegemony. Officially disavowed in 20th century but Trump's 2026 Venezuela intervention suggests its revival - America's original [[Spheres of Influence|sphere of influence]] claim.

## Origins (1823)

### Context
- Latin American independence movements
- Fear of European reconquest
- British support (naval power)
- US still weak but ambitious

### President Monroe's Message
December 2, 1823 - Annual message to Congress:

> "The American continents... are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers."

### Key Principles
1. **Non-colonization**: No new European colonies in Americas
2. **Non-intervention**: Europe stays out of American affairs
3. **Non-interference**: US stays out of European affairs
4. **Separate spheres**: Two hemispheres, two systems

## Evolution

### Early Period (1823-1898)
- More aspiration than reality
- British Navy actually enforced it
- US lacked power to back it up
- Invoked selectively

### Roosevelt Corollary (1904)
Theodore Roosevelt expanded doctrine:
> US has right to intervene in Latin America to maintain order

- "International police power"
- Justified interventions in Caribbean, Central America
- Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Haiti occupations

### Dollar Diplomacy (1909-1913)
- Economic leverage added
- US banks, corporations as tools
- Financial control without occupation

### Good Neighbor Policy (1933)
FDR renounced intervention:
- Non-intervention pledged
- Reciprocal trade
- Multilateral approach
- OAS framework

### Cold War Era
- Anti-communist justification
- Guatemala (1954), Cuba (1961), Chile (1973)
- Reagan Doctrine in Central America
- Covert over overt

### Post-Cold War
- Doctrine considered obsolete
- Multilateralism emphasized
- OAS, regional institutions
- China, Russia engagement tolerated

## 2026: The Return?

### Venezuela Intervention
- US captured Maduro in night raid
- Trump: "US is in charge of Venezuela"
- Oil access explicitly cited
- No consultation with OAS
- Unilateral military action

### Greenland Threats
- Extends Monroe logic to Arctic?
- Western Hemisphere expansion
- Resource/security justification

### Hal Brands Analysis
Trump calculating US can dominate its hemisphere:
> "If the great powers grab spheres of influence in their neighborhoods, the US — with its unmatched military and its vast, resource-rich domain in the Western Hemisphere — will have the greatest sphere of them all."

### Stephen Walt Analysis
[[Stephen Walt]] sees Venezuela as pure Monroe Doctrine enforcement:

> "It's not primarily about narcotics, because Venezuela is not a major drug source. It's not about the regime itself... What it is about is putting Latin America on notice. This is our hemisphere and we're going to run it."

- Stated justifications (drugs, democracy) don't hold up
- Real message: US dominance, resistance futile
- Example of [[Predatory Hegemony]] applied regionally
- Old regime left in place - not about governance

### Is It Back?
| Then | Now |
|------|-----|
| Keep Europe out | Keep China/Russia out |
| Prevent colonization | Prevent rival influence |
| Rhetorical | Military action |
| Anti-imperial framing | Pro-American framing |

## Latin American View

### Historical Resentment
- Seen as imperialism, not protection
- Justification for interventions
- Sovereignty violations
- Double standard

### Current Response
- Brazil's "deep concern" only
- Regional institutions impotent
- No capacity to resist
- Accommodation likely

## Implications

### For Latin America
- Reduced autonomy
- US veto on foreign partnerships
- China/Russia ties constrained
- Back to backyard status

### For International Order
- Legitimizes spheres of influence
- Russia, China cite precedent
- Rules-based order undermined
- Regional hegemony normalized

### For US
- Short-term: dominance secured
- Long-term: legitimacy costs
- Resistance grows
- Overextension risk
