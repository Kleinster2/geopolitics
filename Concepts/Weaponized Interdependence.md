# Weaponized Interdependence

## Definition
The use of global economic networks—originally built for mutual gain—as instruments of coercion. States with privileged positions in financial, trade, or information networks can exploit chokepoints to surveil, sanction, or coerce others.

## Key Thinkers
- **Henry Farrell** (Johns Hopkins) - Coauthor of foundational 2019 article
- **Abraham Newman** (Georgetown) - Coauthor, network theory approach

## Core Mechanisms

### Panopticon Effect
Ability to see what flows through networks:
- US can monitor SWIFT transactions
- Tech platforms provide intelligence access
- Supply chain visibility

### Chokepoint Effect
Ability to deny or restrict access:
- SWIFT exclusion (Iran, Russia)
- Dollar clearing denial
- Semiconductor export controls
- Cloud service restrictions

## Forms of Weaponization

### Financial Networks
- SWIFT messaging system
- Dollar clearing through US banks
- Treasury asset freezes
- Secondary sanctions (extraterritorial)

### Technology Networks
- Semiconductor export controls
- Cloud service restrictions
- App store exclusions
- Equipment bans (Huawei)

### Trade Networks
- Tariffs as coercion
- Export controls
- Supply chain dependencies
- Critical mineral access

## The "Weaponization of Capital" Debate (2026)

Following Trump's threats over [[Greenland Crisis|Greenland]], analysts debated whether Europe could leverage its US asset holdings as counter-coercion.

### The Numbers (US Treasury, November 2025)
- European countries hold nearly 40% of foreign US Treasuries
- US assets held within EU exceed $10 trillion
- Norway's sovereign wealth fund: $2.1 trillion

### Analyst Views

**George Saravelos** (Deutsche Bank global head of currency research) identified the US vulnerability:
> "For all its military and economic strength, the US has one key weakness: it relies on others to pay its bills via large external deficits."

He argued that if the Western alliance's geoeconomic stability is "disrupted existentially," Europeans may be less willing to finance US deficits.

**Kit Juckes** (Societe Generale chief currency strategist) was more skeptical:
- US net investment deficit is a "potential threat to the dollar"
- But only if foreign holders are "willing to suffer financially"
- Situation needs to escalate further before Europeans damage investment performance for political purposes

**Jane Foley** (Rabobank head of currency strategy):
- Some rebalancing of dollar positions may have already occurred after the April 2025 "Sell America" trade
- This may protect the dollar from another bout of market jitters

**Carsten Brzeski** (ING):
- Very little the EU could do to *force* private investors to sell US assets
- Could only try to *incentivize* investments in euro assets

### Structural Constraints
1. **Bulk is private**: Most US assets held by private funds, not government-controlled
2. **Self-harm**: European investors would also suffer losses
3. **Fragmented ownership**: Assets spread across many institutions
4. **Non-European beneficial owners**: Some EU-domiciled securities owned by non-Europeans

### Why It Matters
- Represents potential escalation from trade war to financial conflict
- Deutsche Bank openly discussing "weaponization of capital" shows it's becoming a tail risk
- Would directly impact capital markets, not just goods trade

## Risks of Weaponization

### For the Weaponizer
- Incentivizes alternatives (de-dollarization)
- Damages network value
- Retaliatory weaponization
- Loss of neutral hub status

### For Targets
- Economic devastation (Iran example)
- Forced self-sufficiency
- Alternative network development
- Bloc formation

## Historical Context
- Farrell & Newman's 2019 article theorized what is now being discussed in practice
- Pre-2022: Concept mostly theoretical
- Post-2022: Russia sanctions demonstrated scale
- 2025-2026: Debate extends to intra-Western weaponization
