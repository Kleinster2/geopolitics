# Gunboat Diplomacy

## Overview
The use or threat of naval force to achieve diplomatic objectives without full-scale war. Named for the small warships (gunboats) used by imperial powers to coerce weaker states. Considered a relic of the colonial era but making a return in 2026 under Trump's "America First" foreign policy.

## Definition

> The use of limited naval force, or the threat thereof, to secure advantages or concessions from foreign states without resorting to war.

### Key Elements
- Military power as diplomatic tool
- Coercion short of full war
- Asymmetric power relationship
- Often involves naval/maritime dimension
- Achieves political objectives

## Historical Examples

### Imperial Era (19th-Early 20th Century)
| Year | Event | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1854 | Perry's "Black Ships" (Japan) | Forced opening of Japan |
| 1850s-1900s | British in China | Treaty ports, concessions |
| 1902 | Venezuela Crisis | European blockade for debt |
| 1903 | Panama | US backed secession for canal |

### Cold War Era
- Cuban Missile Crisis (naval blockade)
- Taiwan Strait crises
- Persian Gulf tanker escort (1987-88)
- Libya Gulf of Sidra incidents

### Post-Cold War
- Haiti intervention threats (1994)
- Kosovo (1999)
- Persian Gulf carrier deployments

## 2026: The Return of Gunboat Diplomacy

### Hal Brands Analysis
> "The president is pursuing mercantilist ends, like control of Venezuelan oil, through gunboat diplomacy."

### Trump Administration Examples

**Venezuela (January 2026)**
- Night raid to capture Maduro
- Zero US casualties
- Oil access explicitly cited
- Nation now under US control
- Closest parallel: Panama 1989

**Greenland**
- Threats of forcible annexation
- Military options discussed
- Strategic resources as motive
- Against NATO ally

**Houthis/Red Sea**
- Military strikes to restore shipping
- Protecting commercial navigation
- Limited intervention

### The Pattern
- Mercantilist objectives (oil, resources, trade)
- Military force or credible threat
- Against weaker states
- International law secondary
- Rapid, decisive action

## Theoretical Framework

### Realist View
- Power is the currency
- Strong coerce weak
- Morality is window dressing
- Interests drive action
- Normal great power behavior

### Liberal View
- Violates international law
- Undermines institutions
- Delegitimizes power
- Short-term gains, long-term costs
- Returns to 19th century

### The Tension
Gunboat diplomacy works because:
- Great powers have capability
- Weak states lack options
- International community divided

But creates:
- Legitimacy costs
- Coalition against hegemon
- Precedent for others
- Erosion of norms

## Distinction from War

| Gunboat Diplomacy | War |
|-------------------|-----|
| Limited objectives | Unlimited objectives |
| Coercion | Destruction |
| Quick resolution | Prolonged conflict |
| Minimal casualties | High casualties |
| Political aims | Military victory |

## Effectiveness

### When It Works
- Asymmetric power gap
- Limited objectives
- Quick action
- Target isolated
- Low legitimacy target

### When It Fails
- Overreach
- Target has allies
- Objectives unclear
- Prolonged engagement
- International backlash

## Modern Variants

### Economic Coercion
- Sanctions as "financial gunboats"
- Trade leverage
- Dollar weaponization
- Tech denial

### Gray Zone Operations
- Hybrid warfare
- Paramilitary forces
- Deniable action
- Below war threshold

## Implications for International Order

If gunboat diplomacy becomes normalized:
- Rules-based order erodes
- Small states vulnerable
- Might makes right
- Return to 19th century dynamics
- [[Melian Dialogue]] as governing principle
