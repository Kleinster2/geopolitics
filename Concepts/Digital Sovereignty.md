# Digital Sovereignty

## Definition

The claim that states have the right to govern their own cyberspace - controlling data flows, regulating platforms, and building independent infrastructure. Evolved from defensive network security into a comprehensive geopolitical strategy for projecting power.

## Models

A 2024 study in *Digital Society* (Springer) identified four distinct models:

| Model | Champion | Logic |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Rights-based | EU | Sovereignty protects citizen rights (privacy, data protection) |
| Market-oriented | US (legacy) | Private sector leads, government enables |
| Centralization | China | State controls infrastructure and information |
| State-based | Russia | Sovereignty means isolation and control |

### EU Approach: Regulatory Sovereignty
The EU uses market access to globalize standards:
- **GDPR** (2018): Set global data protection baseline
- **Digital Services Act** (2022): Platform accountability
- **AI Act** (2024): Risk-based AI regulation
- **Digital Fairness Act**: Expected mid-2026
- France-Germany Digital Sovereignty Summit (November 2025) launched joint task force

The "Brussels Effect" - companies comply globally rather than maintain separate systems.

### Chinese Approach: Cyber Sovereignty
State control of the information environment:
- Great Firewall (Golden Shield Project, from 1998)
- Data localization requirements
- Platform censorship requirements
- Digital Silk Road - exporting model through infrastructure

### Russian Approach: Sovereign Internet
Isolation as security:
- Sovereign Internet Law (2019): Technical capability to disconnect from global internet
- Moving toward Iran-style dual-internet model
- "16 KB Curtain" - throttling that renders services unusable while maintaining appearance of connectivity
- Russia-Belarus joint "sovereign AI" project (June 2025)

### US Approach: Market Power as Sovereignty
Historical: Open internet promotion (Clinton-era policy)
Current: Weaponizing chokepoints:
- Semiconductor export controls
- SWIFT access
- App store bans (TikTok)
- Submarine cable restrictions — FCC barred Chinese equipment (August 2025); visa sanctions on Chilean officials for advancing China-linked cable (February 2026, see [[Chile-China Cable Sanctions]])

## Key Tensions

### Data Localization vs. Free Flow
- States demand data stay within borders (Russia, China, India, EU variants)
- US tech companies resist (threatens business model)
- Cloud infrastructure concentrated in US/allied hands

### Platform Regulation vs. Innovation
- EU regulates first, risks competitiveness
- US innovates first, risks harm
- China controls domestically, competes globally

### Infrastructure Dependency
- Global South reliant on foreign infrastructure (see [[Digital Colonialism]])
- Africa: 223 data centers across 38 countries, projected $9.15B market by 2029
- India building alternatives: Aadhaar, UPI, Open Network for Digital Commerce

## Critical Events

- **TikTok ban debate (2024-2025)**: Crystallized tension between open internet ideology and national security claims
- **WSIS+20 (December 2025)**: Debated whether governance remains multistakeholder or shifts to state-centric
- **Chile-China cable sanctions (February 2026)**: US revoked visas for three Chilean officials advancing a China-linked submarine cable. First personal sanctions against an allied government over telecom infrastructure. See [[Chile-China Cable Sanctions]].
- **UN Cyber Mechanism (March 2026)**: New permanent body for responsible state behavior in cyberspace

## Critiques

- "Sovereignty" can mean citizen protection (EU) or state repression (China, Russia)
- Risk of [[Splinternet]] - fragmenting the network effects that make internet valuable
- [[Techno-Nationalism]] can lead to unrealistic autarky goals
- Digital sovereignty for Global South often means choosing between dependencies (US vs. China)

- [[Milton Mueller]] - Argues for "denationalized liberalism" over state sovereignty
- Jack Goldsmith - Predicted states would reassert sovereignty (2006)
- [[Tim Wu]] - Net neutrality and platform power
