# War Powers Resolution

## Overview
Federal law (1973) intended to check the president's power to commit the United States to armed conflict without congressional consent. Passed over Nixon's veto in response to Vietnam War-era executive overreach. Remains in effect but routinely contested by presidents.

## Key Provisions

### Consultation Requirement
President must consult Congress "in every possible instance" before committing US troops to hostilities abroad.

### 48-Hour Notification
President must notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying armed forces into:
- Hostilities
- Situations where hostilities are imminent
- Foreign territory while equipped for combat

### 60-Day Clock
After notification, president has 60 days (extendable to 90) to:
- Obtain congressional authorization, or
- Withdraw forces

Without authorization, forces must be withdrawn.

### Reporting
President must report to Congress at least every six months while forces remain engaged.

## History

### Context
- Vietnam War conducted without declaration of war
- Secret Nixon bombing of Cambodia (revealed 1973)
- Congressional concern over erosion of war powers

### Passage
- Introduced by Rep. Clement Zablocki (D-WI)
- Bipartisan support, co-sponsored by veterans
- Passed both houses
- Vetoed by Nixon
- Veto overridden November 7, 1973

## Compliance Record

Presidents have generally resisted the Resolution, viewing it as unconstitutional. They often act "consistent with" rather than "pursuant to" it—a distinction that avoids acknowledging its authority.

**132+ reports submitted since 1973**, including:
- Cambodia evacuation (1975)
- Beirut deployment (1982-83)
- Persian Gulf War (1991)
- Kosovo (1999)
- Libya (2011)
- Syria/ISIS operations (2014-)
- [[Venezuela]] intervention (2026)

## Constitutional Debate

**Executive view**: Resolution unconstitutionally infringes on commander-in-chief authority.

**Congressional view**: Constitution grants Congress power to declare war; Resolution restores intended balance.

**Practice**: Ongoing tension. Presidents comply procedurally while denying the law's binding authority.

## Venezuela Test Case (January 2026)

Operation Absolute Resolve triggered renewed War Powers debate:
- Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) introduced resolution requiring congressional authorization
- Five Republicans initially defected
- [[JD Vance]] cast tie-breaking vote (50-50) to kill resolution
- Administration claimed "inherent constitutional authority"
