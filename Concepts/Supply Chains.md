# Supply Chains (Geopolitics of)

## Overview
The networks that produce and deliver goods have become a central arena of geopolitical competition. COVID-19 and US-China tensions revealed dangerous dependencies. "Supply chain security" is now a national security priority.

## Why Supply Chains Are Geopolitical

### Vulnerabilities Exposed
- **COVID-19**: PPE shortages, vaccine production
- **Chip shortage**: Auto industry paralysis
- **Ever Given**: Suez blockage impact
- **Ukraine war**: Food, energy, neon gas

### Strategic Dependencies
- Single points of failure
- Adversary control of critical inputs
- Weaponization potential
- Resilience vs. efficiency trade-off

## Key Concepts

### Chokepoints
Concentrated control points in supply chains:
- Geographic (Suez, Malacca)
- Production (Taiwan chips)
- Processing (China rare earths)
- Technology (ASML lithography)

### Fragility vs. Resilience
| Efficient (fragile) | Resilient (costly) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Just-in-time | Just-in-case |
| Single source | Multi-source |
| Lowest cost | Secure supply |
| Global optimization | Regional buffers |

### Friend-shoring
Relocating supply chains to allied countries:
- Trusted partners
- Values-aligned
- Reduces adversary leverage
- Trade-off: Less efficient

## Critical Supply Chains

### Semiconductors
**The most critical supply chain**

| Stage | Dominant Player |
|-------|-----------------|
| Design | US (Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm) |
| Manufacturing (advanced) | Taiwan (TSMC 90%+) |
| Equipment | Netherlands (ASML monopoly) |
| Memory | South Korea (Samsung, SK) |
| Assembly/Test | China, Southeast Asia |

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Taiwan concentration (China threat)
- Single equipment supplier
- Long lead times
- Massive capital requirements

**Responses:**
- CHIPS Act (US)
- EU Chips Act
- Fab construction (Arizona, Ohio, Germany)
- Export controls on China

### Critical Minerals
See: [[Critical Minerals]]
- Rare earths: China 60% mining, 90% processing
- Lithium: Australia, Chile, China processing
- Cobalt: DRC 70% mining, China processing

### Pharmaceuticals
- Active ingredients: China, India dominant
- Generic drugs: India
- Medical devices: Global
- Revealed by COVID-19

### Energy
- Oil: OPEC, Russia
- Natural gas: Pipeline dependencies
- LNG: New flexibility
- Renewables: China manufacturing

## China's Position

### Manufacturing Dominance
- "World's factory"
- ~30% global manufacturing
- Deep supplier networks
- Scale advantages

### Control Points
- Rare earth processing
- Solar panel production
- Battery manufacturing
- Electronics assembly

### Vulnerabilities
- Semiconductor imports
- Energy imports
- Food imports
- Technology (high-end)

### Strategy
- "Dual circulation"
- Self-sufficiency push
- Domestic consumption
- Technology independence

## US/Western Response

### Reshoring
Bringing production home:
- CHIPS Act subsidies
- IRA manufacturing incentives
- "Made in America"
- Costly but strategic

### Friend-shoring
Diversifying to allies:
- Mexico (nearshoring)
- India (China alternative)
- Vietnam (manufacturing shift)
- "China+1" strategy

### Stockpiling
Building reserves:
- Strategic petroleum reserve
- Medical supplies
- Critical minerals
- Chips (proposed)

### Export Controls
Denying adversaries:
- Semiconductor equipment
- Advanced chips
- AI technology
- "Small yard, high fence"

## Supply Chain Weaponization

### Examples

| Aggressor | Target | Weapon | Context |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|
| China | Japan | Rare earths (2010) | Senkaku dispute |
| Russia | Europe | Natural gas | Ukraine, leverage |
| US | China | Semiconductors | Tech competition |
| US | Huawei | Component denial | Security concerns |

### Risks of Weaponization
- Invites retaliation
- Accelerates diversification
- Undermines trade system
- Economic fragmentation

## Industrial Policy Revival

### Return of the State
After decades of free market:
- Strategic sectors identified
- Subsidies for domestic production
- Export controls
- Investment screening

### Key Initiatives

| Country/Bloc | Initiative | Focus |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| US | CHIPS Act | Semiconductors |
| US | IRA | Clean energy, EVs |
| EU | Chips Act | Semiconductors |
| EU | Critical Raw Materials Act | Minerals |
| Japan | Economic security law | Multiple sectors |

## Trade-offs

### Efficiency vs. Security
```
              Security
                 ↑
                 │    Autarky
                 │    (North Korea)
                 │
                 │         Friend-shoring
                 │         (current trend)
                 │
                 │              Pre-2020
                 │              Globalization
                 └───────────────────────→ Efficiency
```

### Costs of Reshoring
- Higher prices
- Less specialization
- Slower growth
- Trade fragmentation

### Costs of Not Reshoring
- Strategic vulnerability
- Coercion risk
- Crisis fragility
- Adversary leverage

## Future Trends

1. **Regionalization**: Blocs over global integration
2. **Redundancy**: Multiple suppliers standard
3. **Visibility**: Supply chain mapping
4. **Stockpiles**: Strategic reserves expand
5. **Industrial policy**: States shape production
6. **Technology**: Automation enables reshoring
