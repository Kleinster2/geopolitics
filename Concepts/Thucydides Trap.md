# Thucydides Trap

## Overview
The theory that war becomes highly likely when a rising power threatens to displace an established power. Coined by Graham Allison from Thucydides' observation about the Peloponnesian War. Central framework for understanding US-China competition and the risk of great power conflict.

## Origin

### Thucydides (c. 460-400 BCE)
*History of the Peloponnesian War*:

> "It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable."

### The Historical Case
- Athens: Rising power, commercial, democratic
- Sparta: Established power, military, oligarchic
- Result: 27-year war, both devastated
- Athens lost, Greek civilization weakened

## Graham Allison's Framework

### The Concept
- Coined term "Thucydides Trap" (2012)
- Book: *Destined for War* (2017)
- Applied to US-China relations

### The Data
Allison examined 16 cases over 500 years where rising power challenged ruling power:

| Outcome | Cases |
|---------|-------|
| War | 12 (75%) |
| No war | 4 (25%) |

### Key Examples

**War Cases**
- Germany vs. Britain (WWI)
- Japan vs. US (WWII)
- France vs. Habsburgs (16th-17th c.)
- Athens vs. Sparta

**Escape Cases**
- US vs. Britain (late 19th c.)
- Portugal vs. Spain (15th c.)
- US-USSR (Cold War - debatable)

## The Mechanism

### Rising Power Psychology
- Growing strength breeds ambition
- Demands recognition, respect
- Chafes at old rules
- Wants seat at table
- May become aggressive

### Established Power Psychology
- Fear of displacement
- Status anxiety
- Preventive war temptation
- Overreaction to challenges
- May become aggressive

### The Trap
- Neither wants war initially
- Actions interpreted as threatening
- Security dilemma dynamics
- Spiral of hostility
- War "inevitable"?

## US-China Application

### The Parallel
| Athens | China |
|--------|-------|
| Rising economy | Rising economy |
| Commercial power | Commercial power |
| Naval expansion | Naval expansion |
| Challenging status quo | Challenging status quo |

| Sparta | United States |
|--------|---------------|
| Established hegemon | Established hegemon |
| Military dominance | Military dominance |
| Alliance leader | Alliance leader |
| Fears displacement | Fears displacement |

### Current Dynamics
- China GDP approaching US
- Military modernization
- South China Sea expansion
- Taiwan threat
- Tech competition
- US containment response

### War Likely?
**Pessimists say:**
- Historical pattern strong
- Structural forces powerful
- Taiwan flashpoint
- Nationalism on both sides

**Optimists say:**
- Nuclear weapons change calculus
- Economic interdependence
- Leadership can choose peace
- No inevitability

## Critiques

### Historical Objections
- Case selection bias
- Causation unclear
- Context matters more
- Not all rises cause war

### Theoretical Objections
- Too deterministic
- Ignores agency
- Nuclear era different
- Interdependence matters

### Policy Objections
- Self-fulfilling prophecy risk
- Encourages hawkishness
- Ignores cooperation options
- Binary framing

## Escape Routes

### How to Avoid the Trap
1. **Accommodation**: Make room for rising power
2. **Integration**: Bind into existing order
3. **Deterrence**: Make war too costly
4. **Communication**: Reduce misperception
5. **Managed competition**: Rules for rivalry

### Historical Lessons
- US-UK transition: Peaceful because UK accommodated
- Cold War: Contained without hot war (barely)
- Key: Leadership choices matter

## 2026 Context

### Tensions Rising
- Taiwan military exercises
- South China Sea confrontation
- Tech decoupling
- [[Arms Control]] collapsed
- Rhetoric hardening

### The Question
Is US-China on path to war, or can it escape the trap?

## Connection to Melian Dialogue

Both concepts from Thucydides:
- [[Melian Dialogue]]: Power determines outcomes
- Thucydides Trap: Rising vs. established power dynamics

Together: Great power politics is tragic, driven by fear and power, often ending in catastrophe.
