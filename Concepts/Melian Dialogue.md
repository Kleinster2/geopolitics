# Melian Dialogue

## Overview
Ancient Greek text from Thucydides' *History of the Peloponnesian War* (416 BCE) that encapsulates the realist view of international relations: **"The strong do what they will and the weak suffer what they must."** Increasingly cited as the ethos of the emerging post-liberal international order.

## The Historical Event

### Context
- 416 BCE, during Peloponnesian War
- Athens demanded Melos (neutral island) submit or be destroyed
- Melians appealed to justice, neutrality, Spartan aid
- Athenians dismissed all arguments

### The Athenian Position
> "The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must."

Key Athenian arguments:
- Justice only exists between equals in power
- The powerful need not justify themselves to the weak
- Appeals to fairness are meaningless without power to enforce
- Gods and men alike rule wherever they can

### Outcome
- Melos refused submission
- Athens besieged and conquered the island
- All adult men executed
- Women and children enslaved
- Island repopulated with Athenian colonists

## Theoretical Significance

### For Realism
The Melian Dialogue is the ur-text of [[Realism]]:
- Power, not morality, governs international relations
- No world government means no enforceable justice
- Survival requires self-help
- Idealism leads to destruction (Melos)

### The Counterargument
Athens' fate suggests limits of pure power logic:
- Athens lost the war (404 BCE)
- Overreach contributed to defeat
- Moral legitimacy has strategic value
- Pure coercion breeds resistance

## 2026 Relevance

### The Return of Melian Logic
Hal Brands (January 2026):
> "If the US makes the Melian Dialogue — the idea that the strong do what they will and the weak suffer what they must — its ethos, it will lose the global legitimacy that lubricates the use of American strength."

### Trump Administration
Stephen Miller: "We live in a world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time."

### Examples of Melian Logic in Practice
| Actor | Action | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **United States** | Maduro extraction, Greenland threats | Venezuela, Denmark |
| **Russia** | Ukraine invasion, territorial annexation | Ukraine |
| **China** | South China Sea militarization | Southeast Asian claimants |
| **Israel** | Buffer zone expansions | Lebanon, Gaza |

## The Liberal Order Alternative

The post-1945 liberal international order was explicitly designed to **reject** Melian logic:
- Rules apply to strong and weak
- Institutions constrain power
- Legitimacy matters
- Conquest prohibited
- Smaller states have rights

### The Tension
- US built order but also violated it (Guatemala, Chile, Iraq)
- Hypocrisy charges from revisionist powers
- Question: Can rules survive without power to enforce them?

## Strategic Implications

### For Great Powers
- Short-term: Melian logic works
- Long-term: Breeds coalitions, resistance, overreach
- Legitimacy is a strategic asset

### For Small States
- Band together (alliances)
- Seek protectors
- Develop asymmetric capabilities
- Appeal to norms (limited utility)

### For International Order
If Melian logic prevails:
- Rules become meaningless
- Might makes right
- Spheres of influence return
- Small state sovereignty erodes
