# Nuclear Proliferation

## Definition
The spread of nuclear weapons, weapons technology, and fissile material to states or non-state actors that do not currently possess them. A central concern of international security since 1945.

## Nuclear Club Evolution

| State | Year | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| United States | 1945 | First nuclear weapon |
| Russia (USSR) | 1949 | Cold War rival |
| United Kingdom | 1952 | US cooperation |
| France | 1960 | Independent deterrent |
| China | 1964 | Revolutionary power |
| Israel | ~1967 | Undeclared |
| India | 1974/1998 | Peaceful test → weaponized |
| Pakistan | 1998 | Response to India |
| North Korea | 2006 | Withdrew from NPT |

## Non-Proliferation Regime

### Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT, 1968)
Three pillars:
1. **Non-proliferation**: Non-nuclear states commit not to acquire
2. **Disarmament**: Nuclear states commit to eventual elimination
3. **Peaceful use**: All states can access civilian technology

- 191 parties (near-universal)
- Non-parties: India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea (withdrew)

### IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency)
- Safeguards and inspections
- Verifies peaceful use
- Reports violations to UN

### Other Instruments
- Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) - not in force
- Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT) - negotiations stalled
- Nuclear Suppliers Group - export controls
- Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)

## Proliferation Pathways

### Uranium Route
- Enrichment (centrifuges)
- Natural uranium → enriched → weapons-grade (90%+)
- Easier to conceal
- Iran's approach

### Plutonium Route
- Reprocessing spent fuel
- Requires reactor
- North Korea's initial approach

### Acquisition Methods
- Indigenous development
- Technology transfer (A.Q. Khan network)
- Theft/black market
- State assistance

## Current Proliferation Concerns

### Iran
- Advanced enrichment (60%)
- JCPOA collapse (2018)
- Breakout time: weeks
- Regional implications

### North Korea
- Expanding arsenal
- Advancing delivery systems
- Beyond regime change
- Accepted as nuclear?

### Saudi Arabia
- Nuclear hedging
- If Iran acquires weapons
- Pakistan connection speculation

### South Korea/Japan
- Technical capability
- Extended deterrence doubts
- Threshold states

## Why States Pursue Nuclear Weapons

### Security
- Deterrence against existential threats
- Balance powerful adversary
- Insurance against abandonment

### Prestige
- Great power status
- International influence
- Domestic legitimacy

### Bargaining
- Leverage for concessions
- Attention/negotiations

## Why States Don't (or Gave Up)

### Restraint Factors
- Alliance protection (extended deterrence)
- Economic costs
- International pressure/sanctions
- Normative constraints
- Technical barriers

### Rollback Cases
- South Africa (dismantled)
- Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus (inherited, gave up)
- Libya (abandoned program)
- Iraq (destroyed by war/inspections)

## Nuclear Security Concerns
- Theft of material
- Insider threats
- Terrorist acquisition
- "Loose nukes" fears
