# Semiconductors

## Overview
The most strategically important technology of the 21st century. Chips power everything from smartphones to missiles to AI. Control over semiconductor supply chains has become central to US-China competition, with Taiwan's TSMC as the critical chokepoint.

## Why Semiconductors Matter

### Ubiquity
Chips are in everything:
- Consumer electronics
- Automobiles (1,000+ chips per car)
- Military systems
- Medical devices
- Industrial equipment
- AI and data centers

### Strategic Importance
- **Economic**: $600B industry, enables trillions more
- **Military**: Modern weapons require advanced chips
- **AI**: Compute power = AI capability
- **National security**: Can't fight modern war without chips

### "New Oil"
> "Semiconductors are the new oil" - Multiple commentators

But more concentrated than oil ever was.

## The Supply Chain

### Stages

```
1. DESIGN          →  2. EQUIPMENT    →  3. MANUFACTURING
(US dominates)        (Netherlands,       (Taiwan dominates
                       Japan, US)          advanced)
        ↓                   ↓                    ↓
4. ASSEMBLY/TEST   →  5. END PRODUCTS
(China, SE Asia)       (Global)
```

### Critical Players

| Stage | Dominant Players | Share |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| Design (logic) | Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, Apple | US ~65% |
| Design (memory) | Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron | Korea, US |
| EDA software | Synopsys, Cadence, Mentor | US ~95% |
| Equipment (litho) | ASML | Netherlands 100% (EUV) |
| Equipment (other) | Applied Materials, LAM, Tokyo Electron | US, Japan |
| Manufacturing (advanced) | TSMC | Taiwan ~90% (<7nm) |
| Manufacturing (mature) | SMIC, GlobalFoundries, Samsung | Diverse |
| Assembly/Test | ASE, Amkor | Taiwan, China |

## The Taiwan Problem

### TSMC Dominance
- **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company**
- 90%+ of advanced chips (<7nm)
- Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm depend on TSMC
- "Most important company you've never heard of"

### Strategic Vulnerability
- Single point of failure
- Taiwan Strait tensions
- China threat
- "Silicon shield" theory

### Scenarios

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| China blockade | Global economic collapse |
| China invasion | Supply destroyed/captured |
| Earthquake | Months of disruption |
| Water shortage | Production constraints |

## US-China Chip War

### US Strategy
**"Small yard, high fence"**

#### Export Controls (October 2022, updated 2023)
- Advanced chips banned to China
- Manufacturing equipment banned
- US persons can't work for Chinese chip firms
- Allied coordination (Japan, Netherlands)

#### Targets
- AI chips (A100, H100 restricted)
- EUV equipment (ASML can't sell to China)
- Advanced logic (<14nm)
- DRAM manufacturing equipment

#### CHIPS Act (2022)
- $52B subsidies for US manufacturing
- TSMC Arizona fab
- Intel expansion
- Samsung Texas
- Guardrails (can't expand in China)

### China's Response

#### Self-Sufficiency Push
- $150B+ investment
- SMIC advances (7nm achieved, struggling)
- Huawei workarounds
- Equipment development
- Talent recruitment

#### Challenges
- Equipment gap (EUV)
- Yield problems
- Talent shortage
- Years behind
- Sanctions tightening

#### Progress
- Mature nodes: Competitive
- Advanced nodes: 5-10 years behind
- Equipment: Major gap
- Memory: Better position

## Key Companies

### TSMC (Taiwan)
- Founded 1987 (Morris Chang)
- Invented foundry model
- Most advanced manufacturing
- $100B+ capex planned
- Expanding to US, Japan, Germany

### Samsung (Korea)
- Integrated (design + manufacturing)
- #2 in foundry
- Memory leader
- US fab (Texas)

### Intel (US)
- Was #1, fell behind
- "IDM 2.0" turnaround plan
- US fabs expanding
- Foundry services launch

### NVIDIA (US)
- AI chip leader
- GPU dominance
- Fabless (uses TSMC)
- Most valuable chip company

### ASML (Netherlands)
- Only EUV maker
- Extreme ultraviolet lithography
- $200M+ per machine
- Irreplaceable chokepoint

### SMIC (China)
- Largest Chinese foundry
- Sanctioned by US
- Achieved 7nm (limited)
- Equipment constrained

## Chip Types and Uses

### Logic Chips
- Processing, computing
- CPUs, GPUs, AI accelerators
- Most geopolitically sensitive
- Advanced nodes critical

### Memory Chips
- Storage (DRAM, NAND)
- Less concentrated
- Korea dominates
- China making progress

### Analog/Mixed Signal
- Sensors, power management
- Mature nodes sufficient
- Less supply chain concern

### Specialized
- Automotive
- Industrial
- Telecom
- Defense (radiation-hardened)

## Manufacturing Complexity

### Why So Hard?
- Features smaller than virus
- Atomic-level precision
- Thousands of steps
- $20B+ per fab
- Years to build
- Decades of knowledge

### Node Progression
| Node | Year | Transistor Density |
|------|------|-------------------|
| 28nm | 2011 | Mature |
| 14nm | 2014 | Mainstream |
| 7nm | 2018 | Advanced |
| 5nm | 2020 | Leading edge |
| 3nm | 2022 | Cutting edge |
| 2nm | 2025 | Next gen |

### EUV Lithography
- Required for <7nm
- Only ASML makes it
- 13.5nm wavelength light
- $200M+ machines
- China can't get them

## Geopolitical Implications

### US Leverage
- Controls design tools
- Controls equipment (with allies)
- Can deny China access
- Chokepoint power

### China's Vulnerability
- Cannot make advanced chips
- Cannot get equipment
- Dependent on imports
- Military implications

### Taiwan's Position
- "Silicon shield" protection?
- Or target for seizure?
- Irreplaceable... for now
- Diversification underway

### Allied Coordination
- US-Japan-Netherlands alignment
- Equipment controls
- Technology sharing
- Supply chain cooperation

## Future Outlook

### Short-term (2025-2028)
- US fabs come online
- China advances (slowly)
- Taiwan remains critical
- Controls tighten

### Medium-term (2028-2035)
- Geographic diversification
- China domestic progress
- New architectures
- Quantum computing?

### Long-term
- Less concentrated supply?
- US-China tech bifurcation?
- Taiwan status?
