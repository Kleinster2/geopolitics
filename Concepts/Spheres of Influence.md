# Spheres of Influence

## Overview
Geographic regions where a great power exercises predominant control or influence, often at the expense of smaller states' sovereignty. A 19th-century concept that Russia and China seek to restore, and which Trump's America may now embrace - signaling a fundamental shift away from the post-1945 liberal order.

## Definition

A region where a major power:
- Dominates security arrangements
- Limits other powers' influence
- Constrains smaller states' foreign policy choices
- May or may not control territory directly

### Not the Same As
- **Empire**: Direct territorial control
- **Alliance**: Voluntary partnership
- **Hegemony**: System-wide dominance

## Historical Examples

### Classic Era (19th-Early 20th Century)
| Power | Sphere |
|-------|--------|
| Britain | South Asia, Middle East, parts of Africa |
| France | North/West Africa, Indochina |
| Russia | Central Asia, Manchuria |
| United States | Latin America (Monroe Doctrine) |
| Japan | Korea, Manchuria, China coast |

### Cold War
- **Soviet Sphere**: Eastern Europe, parts of Third World
- **US Sphere**: Western Europe, Latin America, East Asia
- Clearly demarcated
- Limited sovereignty for sphere members

### Post-Cold War Rejection
Liberal order principles rejected spheres:
- All states have sovereignty
- No "backyards" or "near abroads"
- Small states choose own alliances
- NATO enlargement as example

## 2026: Spheres Return

### Hal Brands Analysis
> "If the great powers grab spheres of influence in their neighborhoods, the US — with its unmatched military and its vast, resource-rich domain in the Western Hemisphere — will have the greatest sphere of them all."

### Russia's Sphere Ambitions
- Ukraine invasion to prevent Western integration
- "Near abroad" concept
- Former Soviet states as buffer
- No NATO on borders
- Belarus as model

### China's Sphere Ambitions
- South China Sea as internal lake
- Taiwan absorption
- Regional hierarchy with China at top
- Belt and Road as influence tool
- Push US out of Western Pacific

### Trump's Western Hemisphere
- Venezuela intervention (2026)
- Greenland annexation threats
- Monroe Doctrine revival?
- "US is in charge of Venezuela"
- Explicit resource control

## The Logic of Spheres

### For Great Powers
- Security buffer
- Resource access
- Prestige/status
- Reduce competition
- Control escalation

### For Small States
- Loss of autonomy
- Constrained choices
- "Finlandization"
- Must accommodate great power
- Limited sovereignty

## Spheres vs. Liberal Order

| Spheres of Influence | Liberal Order |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Great power prerogatives | Sovereign equality |
| Regional hierarchy | Universal rules |
| Constrained sovereignty | Full sovereignty |
| Exclusive zones | Open system |
| 19th century | Post-1945 |

### The Tension
- Russia/China want spheres recognized
- US built order rejecting spheres
- Now US may want its own sphere
- Can't have both

## Trump's Strategic Calculation

Per Hal Brands:
- If spheres are the new norm...
- US has best geographic position
- Western Hemisphere is resource-rich
- Unmatched military dominance
- "Greatest sphere of them all"

### The Bet
Accept world of competing spheres because US wins that game.

### The Risk
- Legitimizes Russia/China spheres
- Alienates allies
- Destroys institutions US built
- Other powers balance against US

## Implications

### For Europe
- US accepting Russian sphere = abandoning Eastern Europe?
- NATO credibility in question
- European strategic autonomy urgent

### For Asia
- Chinese sphere = Taiwan, South China Sea
- US allies (Japan, Philippines, Australia) exposed
- Regional order transformed

### For Latin America
- Already in US sphere historically
- Venezuela intervention confirms
- Reduced autonomy
- Back to Monroe Doctrine
