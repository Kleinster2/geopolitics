# Economic Interdependence

## Definition
A relationship where states are mutually dependent on each other economically through trade, investment, and financial ties. Central to liberal theory's argument that economic connections constrain conflict.

## Key Thinkers
- Richard Rosecrance
- Robert Keohane
- Joseph Nye
- Dale Copeland

## Core Arguments

### Liberal View (Peace Through Trade)
1. Trade creates mutual gains
2. War destroys valuable economic ties
3. Interdependence raises costs of conflict
4. Economic interests lobby against war
5. "Trading states" replace "military states"

### Skeptical View (Dependence as Vulnerability)
1. Asymmetric interdependence creates leverage
2. Can be weaponized (sanctions, supply chain control)
3. WWI: Interdependence didn't prevent war
4. Economic ties don't override security concerns
5. Creates new conflict sources (trade disputes)

## Types of Interdependence

### Trade Interdependence
- Import/export reliance
- Bilateral trade volumes
- Specialized production chains

### Financial Interdependence
- Cross-border investment
- Currency holdings
- Debt relationships

### Supply Chain Interdependence
- Intermediate goods trade
- Production network integration
- Chokepoint dependencies

### Energy Interdependence
- Oil/gas imports
- Pipeline dependencies
- OPEC dynamics

## Measuring Interdependence

### Indicators
- Trade-to-GDP ratios
- Bilateral trade volumes
- Foreign direct investment (FDI)
- Financial asset holdings
- Supply chain mapping

### Asymmetry Matters
- Who needs whom more?
- Alternative partners available?
- Adjustment costs

## Historical Debate

### Pre-WWI Globalization
- High trade interdependence
- Norman Angell: War economically irrational
- 1914: War happened anyway
- Lesson: Interdependence insufficient

### Post-WWII Order
- Bretton Woods institutions
- Trade expansion (GATT/WTO)
- European integration
- "Long peace" correlation

## Contemporary Issues

### US-China Interdependence
- Massive trade relationship
- "Chimerica" dependence
- Decoupling debates
- Tech/supply chain concerns
- Interdependence hasn't prevented rivalry

### Weaponized Interdependence
- Using economic ties as coercion
- SWIFT/dollar dominance
- Technology chokepoints (semiconductors)
- Supply chain leverage
- "Economic statecraft"

### Russia-Europe Energy
- Gas dependence (pre-2022)
- Weaponization by Russia
- European diversification response
- Limits of interdependence logic

### US-Europe Financial (2026 Debate)
- European countries hold nearly 40% of foreign US Treasuries
- US assets held within EU exceed $10 trillion (US Treasury data, November 2025)
- [[Greenland Crisis]] sparked debate: could Europe leverage holdings against US?
- Structural constraints: mostly private holdings, self-harm risk
- See [[Weaponized Interdependence]] for analysis

## Decoupling Debates

### Arguments For
- Reduce vulnerability
- National security
- Resilience over efficiency
- Values-based trade

### Arguments Against
- Economic costs
- Impossible to fully decouple
- Accelerates bloc formation
- Reduces peace incentives
