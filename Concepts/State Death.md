# State Death

## Overview
The phenomenon of sovereign states ceasing to exist - being conquered, absorbed, or partitioned out of existence. The dramatic decline in state death since 1945 is one of the most significant but underappreciated achievements of the liberal international order.

## The Key Statistic

Hal Brands (January 2026):
> "Between 1816 and 1945, a quarter of the world's states simply vanished from the map at some point. Since 1945, 'state death' has become vanishingly rare."

## Historical Pattern (1816-1945)

### Scale of State Death
- ~25% of states disappeared at some point
- Conquest was normal great power behavior
- Borders constantly redrawn
- Small states highly vulnerable

### Examples
| State | Fate | Year |
|-------|------|------|
| Poland | Partitioned (Prussia, Russia, Austria) | 1795 |
| Papal States | Absorbed into Italy | 1870 |
| Hawaii | Annexed by United States | 1898 |
| Korea | Annexed by Japan | 1910 |
| Austria | Annexed by Nazi Germany | 1938 |
| Czechoslovakia | Dismembered by Germany | 1938-39 |
| Baltic States | Absorbed by USSR | 1940 |
| Poland (again) | Partitioned (Germany, USSR) | 1939 |

### Why So Common?
- No prohibition on conquest
- Balance of power as only check
- Empires expanded continuously
- No institutional constraints
- Might made right

## Post-1945 Transformation

### The New Norm
- Territorial conquest delegitimized
- Borders considered sacrosanct
- UN Charter Article 2(4): No use of force against territorial integrity
- Even failed states preserved (Somalia)

### Why the Change?
1. **WWII trauma** - Conquest led to catastrophe
2. **Nuclear weapons** - Made great power war too costly
3. **Decolonization** - New states gained sovereignty protections
4. **US hegemony** - Enforced prohibition on conquest
5. **International institutions** - Codified norms
6. **Economic integration** - Trade better than territory

### Rare Post-1945 Cases
| Event | Outcome |
|-------|---------|
| Tibet (1950) | Absorbed by China |
| Sikkim (1975) | Merged into India |
| South Vietnam (1975) | Conquered by North |
| East Germany (1990) | Reunification (consensual) |
| South Yemen (1990) | Unified with North |

Note: Most post-1945 territorial changes involved **new state creation** (decolonization, USSR breakup), not elimination.

## 2026: Norm Under Threat

### Russia's Challenge
- Crimea annexation (2014) - first European conquest since WWII
- Attempted Ukraine conquest (2022-)
- Explicit rejection of post-1945 norms
- Other territories claimed (Moldova, Georgia)

### Trump's Greenland Threats
- US threatening to annex ally's territory
- Would be first NATO-on-NATO territorial seizure
- Signals norm erosion from within

### Implications
If conquest prohibition erodes:
- Small states become vulnerable again
- Historical pattern could return
- Buffer states, spheres of influence
- 19th century dynamics

## Theoretical Significance

### For Realists
- Confirms power matters
- Norms only work when enforced
- US hegemony was key
- Decline = return to historical norm

### For Liberals
- Shows institutions can transform behavior
- Norms have independent power
- Conquest became unthinkable
- But requires maintenance

### For Constructivists
- Ideas changed state behavior
- Sovereignty norm constructed
- Shared understanding mattered
- Can be deconstructed too
