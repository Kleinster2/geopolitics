# International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)

## Overview
Federal statute (50 U.S.C. 1701-1708) enacted in 1977 granting the president broad economic powers during declared national emergencies. Originally designed for sanctions and asset freezes, IEEPA became the legal basis for Trump's 2025 tariff campaign -- a use now under Supreme Court review.

## Statutory Authority

### What IEEPA Authorizes
Under a declared national emergency, the president may:
- Investigate, regulate, or prohibit transactions in foreign exchange
- Regulate banking transfers involving foreign interests
- Investigate, block, or prohibit acquisition or transfer of property in which a foreign country or national has any interest
- "Regulate... importation" of property subject to US jurisdiction

### What IEEPA Does Not Say
The statute does not mention "tariffs," "duties," or "taxes." This textual gap is the core legal dispute in [[V.O.S. Selections v. Trump]].

### Key Distinction
Other statutes delegating tariff authority (Section 201, Section 232, Section 301) contain explicit tariff language and detailed procedural/substantive constraints. IEEPA has neither.

## Historical Use

### Traditional Applications
- Asset freezes against hostile states
- Financial sanctions on individuals and entities
- Trade embargoes (Cuba, Iran, North Korea)
- Blocking transactions with designated entities

### Unprecedented 2025 Application
Trump administration invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs on virtually all US trading partners, citing:
- Fentanyl trafficking (Canada, Mexico, China) -- February 2025
- National emergency declaration for reciprocal tariffs -- April 2025
- Trade deficits framed as national security threats

## Constitutional Issues

### Article I, Section 8
The Constitution grants Congress the power to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises" and to "regulate Commerce with foreign Nations." Tariffs are fundamentally a power to tax, which several Supreme Court justices underscored during oral arguments in November 2025.

### Major Questions Doctrine
Actions of "vast economic and political significance" require clear congressional authorization. The Federal Circuit described the IEEPA tariffs as "unheralded" and "transformative" -- language invoking this doctrine.

### Nondelegation Doctrine
If IEEPA does authorize tariffs, does the statute place sufficient constraints on that authority? District courts found IEEPA provides "neither quantitative nor qualitative restrictions" on the scope, amount, or duration of tariffs -- potentially an unconstitutional delegation.

## Court Rulings

### Lower Courts (May-August 2025)

| Court | Date | Ruling |
|-------|------|--------|
| Court of International Trade (CIT) | May 28, 2025 | IEEPA does not authorize tariffs; permanent injunction |
| D.C. District Court (Judge Contreras) | May 29, 2025 | IEEPA does not authorize tariffs; preliminary injunction |
| Federal Circuit (en banc, 7-4) | August 29, 2025 | Affirmed CIT; IEEPA lacks tariff authority; major questions doctrine violated |

All three courts concluded that the power to "regulate" imports is distinct from the power to "tax" them.

### Supreme Court
- Cert granted and cases consolidated: September 9, 2025
- Oral arguments: November 5, 2025
- Decision expected: By mid-2026 (possibly February 20, 2026 or later)

See [[V.O.S. Selections v. Trump]] for full case details.

## Revenue and Fiscal Impact

### Tariff Revenue Collected
- FY2025 customs duties: approximately $195-217 billion (per CRFB, Richmond Fed), up from approximately $80 billion in FY2024
- IEEPA-specific tariff revenue since April 2, 2025: estimated $75-85 billion (per World Gold Council)
- FY2026 projections range from $191 billion (Tax Foundation) to $323 billion (Penn Wharton)

### Refund Implications
If the Supreme Court strikes down IEEPA tariffs, importers who paid duties under those orders may seek refunds. The Court of International Trade ruled in December 2025 that it retains authority to order reliquidation even after entry liquidation, preserving refund rights.
