# Lisbon Treaty

## Overview
Treaty reforming the [[European Union]]'s constitutional basis. Signed December 2007, entered into force December 2009. Replaced the failed EU Constitution, restructured institutions, and clarified division of competences between EU and member states.

## Key Facts
- **Signed**: December 13, 2007 (Lisbon, Portugal)
- **In force**: December 1, 2009
- **Amends**: Treaty on European Union (TEU) and Treaty establishing the European Community (renamed TFEU)
- **Replaces**: Failed Constitutional Treaty (rejected by France/Netherlands referendums, 2005)

## Major Changes

### Institutional Reforms
- **European Council President**: New permanent position (replacing rotating presidency)
- **High Representative**: Combined foreign policy chief + Commission VP
- **European Parliament**: Expanded co-decision to most policy areas ("ordinary legislative procedure")
- **Council voting**: Double majority system (55% of states representing 65% of population)

### Competence Division
Clarified three categories of EU competence:

| Category | Meaning | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Exclusive** | Only EU can legislate | Customs union, competition, **common commercial policy (trade)**, monetary policy (eurozone) |
| **Shared** | Both EU and states can act | Environment, transport, energy, internal market |
| **Supporting** | EU can only support states | Culture, tourism, education, health |

### Trade Policy (Article 207 TFEU)
Common commercial policy is **exclusive EU competence**:
- EU negotiates trade deals on behalf of all member states
- Commission negotiates, Council authorizes and concludes
- European Parliament must consent
- **National parliaments have no formal role** (for purely trade matters)

This is the legal basis for the [[EU-Mercosur FTA]] "split deal" controversy.

### Charter of Fundamental Rights
Made legally binding (previously declaratory). UK and Poland obtained opt-outs.

### Exit Clause
Article 50: First formal mechanism for member state withdrawal. Used by UK for [[Brexit]].

## The Competence Question

### Why It Matters for Trade
If a trade agreement covers **only** exclusive EU competences:
- Council + [[European Parliament]] approval sufficient
- National parliaments excluded

If it touches **shared** competences (investment protection, services):
- Becomes "mixed agreement"
- Requires all 27 national parliaments to ratify

### Court of Justice Rulings
- **Opinion 2/15 (2017)**: EU-Singapore FTA. Court ruled portfolio investment and investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) are shared competences, requiring mixed agreement.
- This precedent shapes all subsequent trade deal structures.

### The Split Strategy
Post-Singapore ruling, Commission began splitting deals:
1. Trade-only portion → EU-only procedure
2. Investment/other portions → Mixed procedure

This is what the Commission did with [[EU-Mercosur FTA]], prompting the Parliament referral to the Court.

## Other Key Provisions

### Ordinary Legislative Procedure
Parliament and Council as co-equal legislators on most matters. Replaced the old "co-decision" terminology.

### National Parliament Role
- New "yellow card" procedure: If 1/3 of national parliaments object, Commission must reconsider proposal
- "Orange card" escalation if majority object
- But **no veto power** over EU legislation in exclusive competence areas

### Enhanced Cooperation
At least 9 member states can proceed with integration if others don't join. Used for:
- Unified Patent Court
- Financial Transaction Tax (stalled)

### Passerelle Clauses
Council can shift policy areas from unanimity to qualified majority voting without treaty change (with European Council unanimity).

## Significance for Trade Policy

The Lisbon Treaty's competence framework is central to current EU trade controversies:

1. **Commission leverage**: Can structure deals to minimize national parliament involvement
2. **Democratic deficit critique**: Elected national legislatures sidelined on major economic agreements
3. **Court as arbiter**: Court of Justice ultimately decides competence boundaries
4. **Parliament pushback**: EU Parliament increasingly asserting its role (Mercosur referral)
