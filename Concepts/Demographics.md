# Demographics

## Overview
Population structure—size, age distribution, growth rates—as a fundamental driver of economic capacity, military power, and geopolitical weight. Increasingly central to strategic analysis as many major powers face aging and shrinking populations.

## Why Demographics Matter

### Economic
- **Labor supply**: Workers produce goods, services, innovation
- **Consumption**: Young/middle-aged populations drive demand
- **Tax base**: Working-age population funds government
- **Savings/investment**: Age structure affects capital formation

### Military
- **Recruitment pool**: Young men historically main source
- **Defense burden**: Fewer workers supporting more retirees = less for defense
- **Risk tolerance**: Aging societies may be more casualty-averse

### Political
- **Elderly voters**: Prioritize pensions, healthcare over defense, growth
- **Dependency ratios**: Political pressure for transfers to elderly
- **Immigration debates**: Demographic pressure vs. cultural resistance

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Significance |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Total Fertility Rate (TFR)** | Births per woman | <2.1 = below replacement |
| **Median Age** | Middle of age distribution | Higher = older society |
| **Dependency Ratio** | Non-working/working age | Higher = more burden |
| **Population Growth** | Annual change | Negative = shrinking |
| **Working-Age Population** | 15-64 year olds | Labor force potential |

## Global Trends

### The Aging World
Most developed countries and China now below replacement fertility:
- **Japan**: TFR ~1.2, median age ~49
- **South Korea**: TFR ~0.7 (world's lowest)
- **China**: TFR ~1.0, shrinking since 2022
- **Germany**: TFR ~1.5
- **US**: TFR ~1.6 (higher than peers due to immigration)

### Regional Variation
- **Sub-Saharan Africa**: High fertility, young populations, growing
- **South Asia**: Transitioning (India now world's most populous)
- **East Asia**: Rapid aging, shrinking
- **Europe**: Below replacement, aging
- **North America**: Below replacement but immigration offsets

## Zeihan's Demographic Determinism

[[Peter Zeihan]] places demographics at center of his framework:

**Core argument:**
- Globalized capitalism requires consumers under 45
- Most major economies are aging past this threshold
- Demographic decline is **irreversible** once past "point of no return"
- Policy interventions (pro-natalist) have failed everywhere

**His projections:**
- China: System collapse within 10 years due to demographics
- Europe: Cannot maintain current economic/welfare model
- US: Relatively better positioned (younger, immigration)

**Criticism:** Deterministic—may underweight automation, productivity, adaptation.

## Case Studies

### China
See [[China Demographic Decline]] for detailed analysis.
- Population shrinking since 2022
- Births at lowest since 1949 (7.92M in 2025)
- Debate over data accuracy (100M+ overcount?)
- One-child policy legacy + rapid urbanization

### Japan
- Pioneered demographic decline
- "Lost decades" partly demographic
- Immigration resistance limits options
- Automation as partial offset

### Russia
- Declining population, low life expectancy
- Brain drain accelerating (post-2022)
- Limits long-term military capacity

### United States
- Below replacement but higher than peers
- Immigration historically offset low fertility
- Political constraints on immigration now
- Regional variation (Sun Belt growth)

## Strategic Implications

### Military Power
Countries with shrinking youth populations face:
- Smaller recruitment pools
- Higher opportunity cost per soldier
- Pressure toward capital-intensive (tech, drones) vs. labor-intensive forces
- Potential "use it or lose it" pressure (China-Taiwan?)

### Economic Competition
- Export-led models require external consumers
- Aging populations consume less, save more (initially), then dissave
- Innovation may slow with fewer young workers
- Automation race as demographic offset

### Alliance Value
- Countries with healthy demographics become more valuable allies
- US interest in India, Indonesia, Vietnam partly demographic
- Europe's demographic weakness = strategic vulnerability

## The Automation Question

Can technology offset demographic decline?

**Optimists:**
- AI/robotics can substitute for labor
- Productivity gains can maintain output with fewer workers
- Japan as test case (high automation, managed decline)

**Pessimists:**
- Automation can't replace consumers
- Care work (elderly) hard to automate
- Transition costs high
- May worsen inequality
