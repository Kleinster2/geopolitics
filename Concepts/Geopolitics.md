# Geopolitics

## What is Geopolitics?

### Definition
The study of how geography (physical and human) shapes international politics, power, and strategy. More broadly today: the strategic competition among states for power, influence, and resources in specific geographic spaces.

### Etymology
- **Geo** (Greek): Earth, land
- **Politics**: Power, governance
- Coined by Rudolf Kjellén (1899)

## Geopolitics vs. International Relations

### International Relations (IR)
**Academic discipline** studying interactions between states (and non-state actors):
- Theoretical frameworks (Realism, Liberalism, Constructivism)
- Broad scope: security, economics, institutions, norms
- Seeks to explain and predict
- Scientific/social science approach

### Geopolitics
**Lens or approach** emphasizing:
- Geographic factors (location, terrain, resources)
- Strategic competition
- Power politics
- Spatial relationships
- Practical/policy orientation

### Key Difference

| IR (Academic) | Geopolitics (Strategic) |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Why do states behave this way? | What should we do about it? |
| Theory building | Strategy and policy |
| Multiple paradigms | Power-focused |
| Scientific aspirations | Practical orientation |
| Normative debates | Instrumental analysis |

**Geopolitics is to IR what strategy is to political science** - more applied, more focused on competition and geography.

## Classical Geopolitics

### Founders

#### Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914)
**Sea Power**
- Naval power determines greatness
- Control of seas = control of trade
- Influenced US, UK, Japan naval buildup
- *The Influence of Sea Power Upon History* (1890)

#### Halford Mackinder (1861-1947)
**Heartland Theory**
- "Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland"
- "Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island"
- "Who rules the World-Island commands the World"
- Eurasian landmass as pivot
- *The Geographical Pivot of History* (1904)

#### Nicholas Spykman (1893-1943)
**Rimland Theory**
- Coastal Eurasia (Rimland) more important than Heartland
- "Who controls the Rimland rules Eurasia"
- Influenced US containment strategy
- *America's Strategy in World Politics* (1942)

#### Karl Haushofer (1869-1946)
**Geopolitik**
- German school
- Lebensraum (living space)
- Discredited by Nazi association
- Geopolitics fell out of favor post-WWII

### Classical Concepts

#### Heartland
- Central Eurasia (Russia/Central Asia)
- Inaccessible to sea power
- Resource-rich
- Land power base

#### Rimland
- Coastal Eurasia
- Europe, Middle East, South/East Asia
- Where sea and land power meet
- Strategic prize

#### Sea Power vs. Land Power
- Maritime states (UK, US, Japan)
- Continental states (Russia, Germany)
- Different strategic logics

## Modern Geopolitics

### Cold War Geopolitics
- Containment (Kennan)
- Domino theory
- Proxy wars by geography
- Third World competition
- Nuclear geography

### Post-Cold War
- "End of geography"? (globalization)
- Geopolitics returns (2000s+)
- Great power competition
- Resource competition
- Climate geopolitics

### Contemporary Use
Today "geopolitics" often means:
- Great power competition
- Strategic rivalry
- Regional power dynamics
- Resource/trade competition
- Less geographic determinism

## Critical Geopolitics

### Critique of Classical
- Geography doesn't determine destiny
- Geopolitics is socially constructed
- Serves political interests
- Maps and narratives are power

### Key Arguments
- Geopolitical "truths" are constructed
- Who gets to define threats?
- Spatial categories are political
- Discourse analysis matters

## Geopolitical Concepts

### Chokepoints
Strategic narrow passages:
- Strait of Hormuz (oil)
- Strait of Malacca (trade)
- Suez Canal
- Panama Canal
- Bab el-Mandeb

### Buffer States
Countries between great powers:
- Ukraine (Russia-West)
- Mongolia (Russia-China)
- Afghanistan (historical)

### Spheres of Influence
Geographic areas of dominance:
- Monroe Doctrine (Americas)
- Russian "near abroad"
- Chinese "core interests"

### Pivot States
Geographically significant swing states:
- Turkey
- Indonesia
- Egypt
- Brazil

## Why Geopolitics Matters

### Geography is Permanent
- Mountains, oceans, rivers don't move
- Distance still matters
- Resources are located
- Climate shapes capability

### Return of Great Power Competition
- US-China rivalry
- Russia revisionism
- Regional competitions
- Geography frames competition

### Resource Politics
- Energy geography
- Critical minerals
- Water resources
- Food security

### Technology Changes Geography
- But doesn't eliminate it
- Cyber has geography
- Space has geography
- Trade routes matter

## Geopolitics of Key Regions

| Region | Geopolitical Significance |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Indo-Pacific | US-China competition, trade routes |
| Europe | Russia-West, energy dependency |
| Middle East | Energy, chokepoints, conflicts |
| Central Asia | Heartland, BRI, resources |
| Arctic | Climate-opened resources/routes |

## This Vault

This vault uses "geopolitics" in the modern, broad sense:
- Strategic competition among powers
- Geographic context for politics
- Power-focused analysis
- Practical/policy relevant

It draws on IR theory but emphasizes:
- Who has power
- How they use it
- Where competition occurs
- What geography enables/constrains
