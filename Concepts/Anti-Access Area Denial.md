# Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD)

## Overview
Military strategy focused on preventing adversary forces from entering an operational area (anti-access) or restricting freedom of action within that area (area denial). China's A2/AD capabilities in the Western Pacific are central to US-China military competition, designed to keep US forces at distance during a Taiwan contingency.

## Definitions

### Anti-Access (A2)
- Prevent adversary from entering theater
- Long-range systems
- Target bases, logistics, carriers
- Strategic effect

### Area Denial (AD)
- Restrict operations within theater
- Shorter-range systems
- Make presence costly
- Operational effect

### Combined Effect
```
A2: Keep them out
AD: If they get in, make them pay
```

## Why A2/AD Matters

### Krepinevich's Warning

[[Andrew Krepinevich]] (CSBA founder) was among the first to articulate A2/AD as a strategic challenge in his 2009 Foreign Affairs article "The Pentagon's Wasting Assets":

- US forward bases increasingly vulnerable to precision strike
- Traditional power projection model breaking down
- Aircraft carriers—icons of American dominance—becoming "wasting assets"
- Required fundamental rethink of military posture

His proposed response: **archipelagic defense**—distribute forces across the [[First Island Chain]], using island geography defensively rather than concentrating on vulnerable mega-bases.

### Strategic Logic
- Asymmetric counter to US dominance
- Cheaper than matching fleet-for-fleet
- Exploits geography
- Changes intervention calculus

### Key Questions
- Can US operate in Western Pacific?
- At what cost?
- Taiwan intervention viable?
- Alliance credibility?

## China's A2/AD Complex

### Geographic Advantage
- Fighting near home
- Interior lines
- Short logistics
- Surveillance density

### Key Systems

#### Ballistic Missiles
| System | Range | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| DF-21D | 1,500 km | Carriers ("carrier killer") |
| DF-26 | 4,000 km | Guam, carriers |
| DF-17 | 1,800 km | Hypersonic glide |

#### Cruise Missiles
- YJ-18, YJ-12 (anti-ship)
- CJ-10 (land attack)
- Air, sea, sub-launched

#### Air Defense
- S-400 (Russian)
- HQ-9 (domestic)
- Integrated network

#### Submarines
- Diesel-electric (quiet)
- Nuclear attack subs
- Minelaying capability

#### Other
- Anti-satellite weapons
- Cyber capabilities
- Electronic warfare

### Operational Concept
1. Surveillance (satellites, radar)
2. Target acquisition
3. Salvo launch (saturation)
4. Deny sea/air control
5. Complicate intervention

## First Island Chain Focus

### China's Objective
- Control within first island chain
- Push US beyond second chain
- Taiwan seizure window
- See: [[Island Chains]]

### Key Targets
- US bases (Japan, Guam)
- Aircraft carriers
- Logistics nodes
- C4ISR networks

## US Counter-Strategies

### Distributed Operations
- Disperse forces
- Reduce target value
- Island-based missiles
- Resilience over concentration

### Stand-Off Strike
- Long-range weapons
- Stay outside A2/AD bubble
- Tomahawks, new missiles
- Bomber emphasis

### Air-Sea Battle / JAM-GC
- Joint All-Domain Operations
- Cross-domain coordination
- Offensive counterforce
- Integrated response

### Pacific Deterrence Initiative
- Base hardening
- Dispersal infrastructure
- Prepositioned equipment
- Allied integration

### US Responses
| Capability | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Long-range missiles | Strike from distance |
| Base hardening | Survive first strike |
| Distributed posture | Reduce target value |
| Allied integration | Expand options |

## Allied A2/AD

### Japan
- Developing own A2/AD
- Southwestern islands
- Counterstrike capability

- See: [[AUKUS]]

## Russian A2/AD

### Kaliningrad
- Baltic Sea denial
- Iskander missiles
- S-400 air defense
- NATO concern

### Crimea/Black Sea
- Sea denial achieved
- Ukraine war demonstrated
- Missile saturation
- See: [[Ukraine Crisis]]

### Arctic
- Northern Fleet
- Bastion defense
- See: [[Arctic Geopolitics]]

## Iran's A2/AD

### Persian Gulf Focus
- Strait of Hormuz
- Fast attack boats
- Anti-ship missiles
- Mines
- See: [[Iran]], [[Chokepoints]]

### Capabilities
- Shore-based missiles
- Naval swarms
- Asymmetric tactics
- Denial objective

## Strategic Implications

### For US
- Power projection challenged
- Costs of intervention up
- Risk calculus changed
- Alliance credibility tested

### For China
- Defensive advantage
- Time for fait accompli
- US hesitation hoped
- Taiwan implications

### For Taiwan
- Intervention uncertainty
- Self-defense priority
- Porcupine strategy
- See: [[Taiwan]]

### For Allies
- Extended deterrence questions
- Own capabilities needed
- Risk sharing
- Abandonment fears

## Limitations of A2/AD

### Not Invincible
- Systems can be defeated
- Countermeasures exist
- Integration challenges
- Untested in combat

### Operational Challenges
- Kill chain complexity
- Targeting in real-time
- Electronic warfare
- Decoys, jamming

### Strategic Issues
- Escalation risks
- Doesn't win wars alone
- Occupation still requires forces
- Sustainability questions

## Future Developments

### Technology Trends
- Hypersonics
- AI targeting
- Swarm systems
- Space-based sensors

### Competition Continues
- Offense-defense spiral
- Cost imposition
- Capability races
- Uncertainty persistent
