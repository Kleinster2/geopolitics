# New START

## Overview
The last remaining US-Russia nuclear arms control treaty. Signed 2010, limits deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems. Russia suspended participation in February 2023 amid Ukraine war tensions. Set to expire February 5, 2026 with no successor negotiated.

## Treaty Limits

| Category | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Deployed warheads | 1,550 |
| Deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, heavy bombers | 700 |
| Deployed and non-deployed launchers | 800 |

## Key Features

### Counting Rules
- Each deployed ICBM/SLBM counts as one warhead per actual loading
- Each heavy bomber counts as one warhead (regardless of actual capacity)
- "New START accountable" vs. actual warheads

### Verification
- On-site inspections (18 per year)
- Data exchanges (biannual)
- Notifications of movements
- National technical means (satellites)

### What's Covered
- ICBMs and their launchers
- SLBMs and their launchers
- Heavy bombers equipped for nuclear weapons

### What's Not Covered
- Tactical nuclear weapons
- Reserve/non-deployed warheads
- Missile defenses
- Conventional precision strike
- Hypersonic weapons
- Third countries (China, UK, France)

## Timeline

### Negotiation (2009-2010)
- Obama administration priority
- "Reset" with Russia
- Replaced START I (expired 2009)
- Signed in Prague, April 2010

### Implementation (2011-2018)
- Both sides met limits by 2018
- Regular inspections
- Data exchanges functioning
- Considered successful

### Extension Debate (2019-2021)
- Trump administration sought to include China (refused)
- Demanded tactical weapons inclusion
- Extended in extremis (February 2021, 5 years)
- Biden administration priority

### Suspension (2023)
- February 21, 2023: Putin announces suspension
- Cites NATO involvement in Ukraine
- US "actively helping" Ukraine strike Russian territory
- Not withdrawal - "suspension of participation"

### Current Status (2024-2026)
- No inspections since COVID (2020)
- No data exchanges
- Russia claims still abiding by limits
- US skeptical but cannot verify
- Expires February 2026

## Russia's Suspension

### Stated Reasons
- US/NATO involvement in Ukraine conflict
- US helping Ukraine strike Russian territory
- Cannot allow inspections of Russian facilities
- "Absurd" to permit US inspectors

### What Suspension Means
- No on-site inspections
- No notifications
- Data exchanges halted
- Treaty technically in force but unimplemented

### US Response
- Criticized as "irresponsible"
- Noted Russia still bound legally
- Suspended some notifications in response
- No withdrawal

## Post-2026 Scenarios

### No Replacement
- Most likely outcome
- No limits on arsenals
- No verification
- Return to pre-arms control era
- Both sides modernizing

### Emergency Extension
- Requires mutual agreement
- Russia demands: end Ukraine support
- US demands: return to compliance
- Gap appears unbridgeable

### New Framework
- Would need to address:
  - China inclusion
  - Tactical weapons
  - New technologies (hypersonics)
  - Verification innovations
- Not currently being negotiated

## Significance of Expiration

### Strategic Stability
- No constraints on deployments
- No transparency on arsenals
- Worse crisis stability
- Miscalculation risks

### Modernization Unleashed
- Both sides already modernizing
- New systems unconstrained
- Arms race dynamics possible
- Costs increase

### Precedent
- Completes arms control collapse
- INF (2019), Open Skies (2020), New START (2026)
- End of post-Cold War framework
- New great power competition era

## Arsenal Estimates (2024)

| State | Deployed Strategic | Total Stockpile |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| United States | ~1,550 | ~5,500 |
| Russia | ~1,550 | ~6,200 |
