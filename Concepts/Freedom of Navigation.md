# Freedom of Navigation

## Overview
The principle that ships of all nations can transit international waters freely. Foundational to global trade and naval power projection. Currently under challenge in multiple strategic waterways, marking erosion of the liberal international order.

## Legal Framework

### [[UNCLOS]] (1982)
UN Convention on the Law of the Sea establishes:
- **Territorial Sea** (0-12nm): Innocent passage allowed
- **Contiguous Zone** (12-24nm): Limited enforcement rights
- **EEZ** (12-200nm): Navigation freedom preserved
- **High Seas** (beyond 200nm): Full freedom

### Key Rights
- **Innocent Passage**: Transit through territorial waters
- **Transit Passage**: Through international straits
- **Archipelagic Sea Lanes**: Through island chains
- **High Seas Freedom**: Unrestricted navigation

### US Position
- Not party to UNCLOS but treats as customary law
- Conducts Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs)
- Challenges "excessive maritime claims"
- Navy as guarantor of open seas

## Strategic Importance

### For Global Trade
- 80% of world trade by volume travels by sea
- Critical commodities (oil, gas, food) depend on shipping
- Just-in-time supply chains require reliable transit
- Disruption = economic crisis

### For Military Power
- Power projection requires naval access
- Forward presence depends on transit rights
- Allies need to be reachable
- Chokepoints are strategic

## 2025-2026: Challenges Mounting

### Red Sea Crisis
- **Houthis** attacking commercial shipping (2023-)
- "Support for Gaza" justification
- Suez route disrupted
- US/UK strikes on Yemen
- Global trade rerouted
- See: [[Houthis]], [[Chokepoints]]

### South China Sea
- China claiming ~90% of sea
- Artificial island militarization
- Harassment of Philippine vessels
- FONOP challenges by US Navy
- See: [[South China Sea]]

### Taiwan Strait
- China claims as internal waters
- US insists on international strait status
- Regular US Navy transits
- Tension with each passage
- See: [[Taiwan]]

### Black Sea
- Russia restricting access
- Grain deal tensions
- Naval mines
- Commercial shipping risks

## [[FONOPs|Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs)]]

### Purpose
- Challenge excessive claims
- Assert legal rights
- Demonstrate commitment
- Prevent fait accompli

### US Operations
- Regular South China Sea patrols
- Taiwan Strait transits
- Challenge 65+ countries' claims
- Bipartisan support

### Risks
- Potential for incidents
- Escalation dynamics
- China views as provocation
- Requires sustained commitment

## Historical Context

### British Role (19th Century)
- Royal Navy guaranteed open seas
- Pax Britannica = freedom of navigation
- Anti-piracy operations
- Trade route protection

### Post-1945 US Role
- Inherited from Britain
- Navy larger than all others combined
- Global presence
- Alliance network

### The Norm
Freedom of navigation became assumed:
- Trade flourished
- Naval competition declined
- Chokepoints stayed open
- Until recently

## Implications of Erosion

### If Freedom Challenged
- Trade routes disrupted
- Shipping costs rise
- Regional powers control access
- Great power competition at sea

### Economic Impact
- Higher insurance costs
- Longer routes
- Supply chain fragility
- Commodity price spikes

### Strategic Impact
- US power projection constrained
- Allies harder to reach
- Regional hegemons empowered
- Maritime order fragments

## Hal Brands (January 2026)
> "Freedom of navigation has been challenged in crucial waterways, from the Red Sea to the Western Pacific."

One of multiple symptoms of liberal order erosion.
