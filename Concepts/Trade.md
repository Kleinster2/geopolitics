# Trade (Geopolitics of)

## Overview
International trade is both an economic activity and a geopolitical arena. Trade agreements shape alliances, market access creates leverage, and trade policy is increasingly weaponized. The post-WWII free trade consensus is fracturing.

## Trade and Power

### Why Trade is Geopolitical

1. **Wealth creation**: Economic power funds military power
2. **Interdependence**: Creates leverage (and vulnerability)
3. **Alliance building**: Trade agreements cement partnerships
4. **Market access**: Reward allies, punish adversaries
5. **Standard-setting**: Rules shape competition

### Historical Pattern
> "If goods don't cross borders, soldiers will" - Attributed to Bastiat

Trade as peace mechanism vs. trade as weapon.

## Global Trade System

### WTO/GATT Framework
- GATT (1947): Tariff reductions
- WTO (1995): Expanded rules, dispute settlement
- Most-Favored Nation: Non-discrimination
- National Treatment: Equal domestic treatment

### Principles
- **Liberalization**: Reduce barriers
- **Non-discrimination**: MFN, national treatment
- **Reciprocity**: Mutual concessions
- **Transparency**: Published rules

### Crisis of WTO
- Doha Round failure (2001-present)
- Appellate Body paralysis (US blocking)
- China challenge (state capitalism)
- Unilateral actions rising

## Trade as Strategy

### Building Alliances

| Agreement | Members | Strategic Purpose |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| USMCA | US, Mexico, Canada | North American integration |
| EU Single Market | 27 European states | European unity |
| CPTPP | 11 Pacific states | Counter China (originally) |
| RCEP | 15 Asian states | China-inclusive Asia |
| African Continental FTA | 54 African states | African integration |

### Excluding Rivals
- CPTPP designed to set rules before China
- US-EU TTC (Trade and Technology Council)
- "Friend-shoring" trade patterns

### Leverage Tool
- Market access as reward
- Tariffs as punishment
- Conditionality (labor, environment)

## US-China Trade War

### Timeline
- 2018: Trump tariffs begin
- 2019: Escalation, partial deal
- 2020: Phase One deal
- 2021+: Biden continues, adds tech

### Measures
- Tariffs: 25% on $250B+ Chinese goods
- Chinese retaliation
- Export controls (tech)
- Investment restrictions

### Results
- Trade deficit persists
- Supply chains shifting (slowly)
- Relations deteriorated
- Decoupling accelerated

## Trade Blocs Emerging

### Not New Cold War Blocs
- Overlapping memberships
- Economic logic persists
- Not binary choice for most

## Types of Trade Policy

### Free Trade
- Minimize barriers
- Comparative advantage
- Consumer benefit
- Pre-2016 consensus

### Protectionism
- Shield domestic industry
- Tariffs, quotas
- National champions
- Rising trend

### Strategic Trade
- Targeted intervention
- Support key sectors
- Industrial policy
- Current approach

### Managed Trade
- Negotiated outcomes
- Bilateral deals
- Results-oriented
- Trump approach

## Trade and Security

### Security Exceptions
- GATT Article XXI: National security exception
- Increasingly invoked
- US steel/aluminum (Section 232)
- Abuse concerns

### Dual-Use Goods
- Technology with military application
- Export controls
- End-use monitoring
- Semiconductors, AI

### Economic Coercion
- Trade measures for political goals
- China's use against Australia, Lithuania
- US sanctions (trade element)
- Counter-coercion tools developing

## Key Trade Disputes

### US-China
- Trade balance
- IP theft
- Market access
- Subsidies

### EU-US
- Steel, aluminum
- Digital services tax
- Agricultural subsidies
- Boeing-Airbus

### China-Australia
- Barley, wine, coal, beef
- Political punishment
- WTO cases

## Regional Trade Dynamics

### Asia-Pacific
- RCEP: Largest by GDP
- CPTPP: High standards
- US absence problematic
- China increasingly central

### Europe
- EU single market deepest integration
- Brexit disruption
- Trade defense strengthening
- Strategic autonomy push

### Americas
- USMCA constrains China
- Nearshoring to Mexico
- Mercosur stagnant

### Africa
- AfCFTA ambitious
- Implementation challenging
- Integration potential

## Future of Trade

### Trends
1. **Securitization**: Trade as security issue
2. **Fragmentation**: Blocs over global
3. **Industrial policy**: States shape trade
4. **Standards competition**: Rules as power
5. **Resilience**: Security over efficiency

### Scenarios

#### Managed Competition
- Trade continues but constrained
- Security carve-outs
- Some cooperation survives

#### Bloc World
- Separate trading systems
- Limited inter-bloc trade
- 1930s echoes

#### Reformed Multilateralism
- WTO revived
- New rules for digital, subsidies
- Optimistic scenario
