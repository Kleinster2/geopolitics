# Space Geopolitics

## Overview
Space has become contested domain in great power competition. Satellites essential for military operations, communications, and surveillance. Anti-satellite weapons threaten space assets. Commercial space revolution reshaping landscape. New actors and capabilities challenging Cold War-era governance. "Space is a warfighting domain" (US doctrine).

## Why Space Matters

### Military Dependence
- GPS/navigation
- Communications
- Intelligence/surveillance
- Early warning
- Precision weapons

### Economic Significance
- Telecommunications
- Earth observation
- Weather forecasting
- Financial systems (timing)
- Internet (emerging)

### Scientific
- Earth monitoring
- Climate data
- Exploration
- Research

## Great Power Competition

### United States
- **Capabilities**: Most advanced
- **Assets**: 3,000+ satellites
- **Military**: Space Force (2019)
- **Commercial**: SpaceX, others dominant
- **Policy**: Space as warfighting domain

### China
- **Growth**: Rapid expansion
- **Capabilities**: Full spectrum
- **Military**: Strategic Support Force
- **Goals**: Lunar base, station
- **ASAT**: Demonstrated (2007)

### Russia
- **Legacy**: Soviet space heritage
- **Capabilities**: Launch, ASAT
- **Challenges**: Economic constraints
- **Behavior**: ASAT tested (2021)
- **Concerns**: Destabilizing tests

### Others
- **India**: ASAT demonstrated (2019)
- **Europe**: ESA capabilities
- **Japan**: Growing program
- **Many**: Satellite operators

## Anti-Satellite Weapons

### Types
| Type | Method |
|------|--------|
| Direct ascent | Missile destroys satellite |
| Co-orbital | Spacecraft attacks |
| Directed energy | Laser dazzling/damage |
| Cyber | Software/hacking |
| Electronic | Jamming, spoofing |

### Tests
- China (2007): Debris-creating
- US (2008): Satellite shootdown
- India (2019): Demonstration
- Russia (2021): Direct ascent test

### Debris Problem
- Tests create debris
- Kessler syndrome risk
- Long-term contamination
- Irresponsible behavior

## Space Governance

### Outer Space Treaty (1967)
- Foundation of space law
- No WMD in space
- Celestial bodies: peaceful
- National appropriation banned
- Cold War relic

### Gaps
- No debris rules
- ASAT ambiguity
- Commercial regulation
- Resource extraction
- Enforcement

### Reform Efforts
- UN discussions
- Norms development
- Limited progress
- Great power differences

## Commercial Revolution

### SpaceX Impact
- Reusable rockets
- Cost reduction
- Launch frequency
- Starlink constellation
- Industry transformation

### Implications
- Democratization
- Military applications
- Regulatory challenges
- Commercial ASAT concerns
- Debris growth

### Starlink and Ukraine
- Communications resilience
- Military application
- Precedent setting
- Control questions

## Military Space Operations

### US Space Force
- Created 2019
- Organize, train, equip
- Space as domain
- Operational integration

### Chinese Integration
- Strategic Support Force
- Space, cyber, EW combined
- PLA integration
- Rapid development

### Capabilities Race
- Space situational awareness
- Counterspace
- Resilience
- Offensive/defensive

## Satellite Constellations

### Mega-Constellations
- Starlink (SpaceX)
- OneWeb
- Amazon Kuiper
- Chinese plans

### Implications
- Debris risks
- Astronomy impact
- Surveillance potential
- Communications resilience
- Governance gaps

## Moon and Beyond

### Artemis Program (US)
- Return to Moon
- Lunar Gateway station
- Allied participation
- Resource extraction

### Chinese Lunar Plans
- Permanent base goal
- Resource interest
- Scientific presence
- Strategic implications

### Artemis Accords
- US-led framework
- Resource extraction norms
- Allied alignment
- China/Russia excluded

### Competition
- Lunar presence race
- Resource claims
- Governance debates
- Two blocs forming?

## Space Debris

### Growing Problem
- Thousands of objects
- Collision risk
- Mission threats
- Long-term sustainability

### Sources
- ASAT tests
- Mission debris
- Collisions
- Aging satellites

### Solutions
- Debris removal
- Design standards
- Traffic management
- Limited progress

## Strategic Implications

### Deterrence
- Space vulnerability
- Escalation concerns
- First-strike incentives
- Stability debates

### Resilience
- Distributed architectures
- Rapid reconstitution
- Commercial augmentation
- Redundancy

### Norms
- Governance gaps
- Responsible behavior
- Great power agreement
- Unlikely near-term

## Future Trajectory

### Trends
- Competition intensifying
- Commercial growth
- Military integration
- Governance lag

### Risks
- Conflict in space
- Debris cascade
- Miscalculation
- Arms race
