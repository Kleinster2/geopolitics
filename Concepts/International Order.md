# International Order

## Overview
The governing arrangements, rules, and institutions that structure relations among states. Orders emerge from power distributions and shared understandings, shaping what states can and cannot do. We are currently witnessing challenges to the post-1945 "liberal international order."

## What is Order?

### Definition
A pattern of activity that sustains elementary goals of society:
- Security (protection from violence)
- Property (agreements kept)
- Stability (predictability)

### Order vs. Anarchy
- Anarchy = no world government
- Order = patterns, rules, expectations despite anarchy
- Order exists within anarchy

### Order vs. Justice
- Order: Stability, predictability
- Justice: Fairness, equality
- Can conflict (status quo vs. change)

## Types of International Order

### By Organizing Principle

#### Hegemonic Order
- One dominant power sets rules
- Others accept/comply
- Stability through dominance
- Example: Pax Britannica, Pax Americana

#### Balance of Power Order
- Multiple great powers
- Equilibrium through balancing
- Flexible alliances
- Example: Concert of Europe (1815-1914)

#### Constitutional Order
- Rules-based with institutions
- Self-binding by major powers
- Legitimacy through process
- Example: Post-1945 order

### By Values/Character

#### Liberal Order
- Open markets
- Democratic governance
- International institutions
- Human rights
- Rule of law

#### Non-Liberal Alternatives
- Authoritarian capitalism
- Spheres of influence
- Civilizational blocs
- Might makes right

## The Liberal International Order (LIO)

### Origins
- Post-WWII construction
- US-led architecture
- Response to 1930s catastrophe
- Cold War context

### Core Components

#### Security
- US alliances (NATO, bilateral)
- Collective security (UN)
- Nuclear umbrella
- Forward military presence

#### Economic
- Open trade (GATT/WTO)
- Monetary stability (IMF)
- Development (World Bank)
- Financial integration

#### Political
- United Nations
- International law
- Human rights norms
- Democracy promotion

### Characteristics
- US hegemony underpins
- Rules-based (mostly)
- Institutionalized
- Open to membership
- Liberal values embedded

## Challenges to Liberal Order

### Structural
- US relative decline
- China's rise
- Power diffusion
- Multipolarity emerging

### Ideological
- Authoritarianism resurgent
- Democracy in retreat
- Nationalism/populism
- Alternative models (China)

### Institutional
- Gridlock (UN Security Council)
- Legitimacy crisis
- Effectiveness questions
- Reform paralysis

### Internal
- US commitment wavering
- Western unity strained
- Trump era damage
- Domestic polarization

## China's Challenge

### Revisionist?
- Within institutions (WTO, UN)
- Parallel institutions (AIIB, BRI)
- Regional order aspirations
- Global South appeal

### Not Revolutionary?
- Benefits from existing order
- Selective revision
- Status quo in some areas
- Not replacing system (yet)

### Alternative Vision
- State capitalism model
- Sovereignty absolutism
- Non-interference
- Multipolarity
- China-centered Asia

## Russia's Challenge

### Grievances
- NATO expansion
- Sphere of influence denied
- Treated as "loser"
- Rules not applied equally

### Actions
- Ukraine invasion
- Norm violation (territorial conquest)
- Institution undermining
- Western order rejection

### Vision
- Great power concerts
- Spheres of influence
- Multipolarity
- Civilizational distinctiveness

## Order Transition Scenarios

### 1. Liberal Order Adapts
- Accommodates rising powers
- Reforms institutions
- Maintains core principles
- Broader legitimacy

### 2. Contested Order
- No clear rules
- Regional spheres
- Great power competition
- Fragmentation

### 3. New Order Emerges
- China-led?
- Different principles
- Long transition
- Unclear outcome

### 4. Disorder
- Rules collapse
- Conflict increases
- Institutions fail
- Historical pattern?

## Historical Orders

| Era | Order | Character |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| 1648-1789 | Westphalian | Sovereign states, balance |
| 1815-1914 | Concert of Europe | Great power management |
| 1919-1939 | Versailles | Failed liberal attempt |
| 1945-1991 | Cold War | Bipolar, competing orders |
| 1991-2008? | Unipolar/Liberal | US hegemony, liberal rules |
| 2008-present | Transitional | Contested, fragmenting |

## Key Debates

### Can Order Survive Power Shift?
- Institutions as stabilizers?
- Or power determines order?

### Liberal Order for Whom?
- Western-centric?
- Universal or particular?
- Hypocrisy charges

### Reform or Replace?
- Adapt existing institutions?
- Build alternatives?
- Coexistence possible?
