# International Order

## Overview
The governing arrangements, rules, and institutions that structure relations among states. Orders emerge from power distributions and shared understandings, shaping what states can and cannot do. We are currently witnessing challenges to the post-1945 "liberal international order."

## What is Order?

### Definition
A pattern of activity that sustains elementary goals of society:
- Security (protection from violence)
- Property (agreements kept)
- Stability (predictability)

### Order vs. Anarchy
- Anarchy = no world government
- Order = patterns, rules, expectations despite anarchy
- Order exists within anarchy

### Order vs. Justice
- Order: Stability, predictability
- Justice: Fairness, equality
- Can conflict (status quo vs. change)

## Types of International Order

### By Organizing Principle

#### Hegemonic Order
- One dominant power sets rules
- Others accept/comply
- Stability through dominance
- Example: Pax Britannica, [[Pax Americana]]

#### Balance of Power Order
- Multiple great powers
- Equilibrium through balancing
- Flexible alliances
- Example: Concert of Europe (1815-1914)

#### Constitutional Order
- Rules-based with institutions
- Self-binding by major powers
- Legitimacy through process
- Example: Post-1945 order

### By Values/Character

#### Liberal Order
- Open markets
- Democratic governance
- International institutions
- Human rights
- Rule of law

#### Non-Liberal Alternatives
- Authoritarian capitalism
- Spheres of influence
- Civilizational blocs
- Might makes right

## The Liberal International Order (LIO)

### Origins
- Post-WWII construction
- US-led architecture
- Response to 1930s catastrophe
- Cold War context

### Core Components

#### Security
- US alliances (NATO, bilateral)
- Collective security (UN)
- Nuclear umbrella
- Forward military presence

#### Economic
- Open trade (GATT/WTO)
- Monetary stability (IMF)
- Development (World Bank)
- Financial integration

#### Political
- United Nations
- International law
- Human rights norms
- Democracy promotion

### Characteristics
- US hegemony underpins
- Rules-based (mostly)
- Institutionalized
- Open to membership
- Liberal values embedded

## Challenges to Liberal Order

### Structural
- US relative decline
- China's rise
- Power diffusion
- Multipolarity emerging

### Ideological
- Authoritarianism resurgent
- Democracy in retreat
- Nationalism/populism
- Alternative models (China)

### Institutional
- Gridlock (UN Security Council)
- Legitimacy crisis
- Effectiveness questions
- Reform paralysis

### Internal
- US commitment wavering
- Western unity strained
- Trump era damage
- Domestic polarization

## China's Challenge

### Revisionist?
- Within institutions (WTO, UN)
- Parallel institutions (AIIB, BRI)
- Regional order aspirations
- Global South appeal

### Not Revolutionary?
- Benefits from existing order
- Selective revision
- Status quo in some areas
- Not replacing system (yet)

### Alternative Vision
- State capitalism model
- Sovereignty absolutism
- Non-interference
- Multipolarity
- China-centered Asia

## Russia's Challenge

### Grievances
- NATO expansion
- Sphere of influence denied
- Treated as "loser"
- Rules not applied equally

### Actions
- Ukraine invasion
- Norm violation (territorial conquest)
- Institution undermining
- Western order rejection

### Vision
- Great power concerts
- Spheres of influence
- Multipolarity
- Civilizational distinctiveness

## 2026: The Order Unravels (Hal Brands Analysis)

### Symptoms of Collapse
The transition away from the post-1945 liberal order is accelerating:
- Superpower "snatching foreign leaders in the dead of night" (Maduro)
- Strong countries threatening to redraw weaker neighbors' borders (Greenland, Ukraine, Himalayas)
- International law and [[Arms Control]] agreements unraveling
- Armed conflict surging as curbs on aggression erode
- [[Freedom of Navigation]] challenged (Red Sea, Western Pacific)
- Rules-based trading system becoming "thing of the past"
- [[Board of Peace]]: Trump-proposed UN rival with $1B membership fee and Trump-centered decision-making (January 2026)

### [[State Death]]: A Telling Statistic
> Between 1816 and 1945, a quarter of the world's states simply vanished from the map at some point. Since 1945, "state death" has become vanishingly rare.

This stability is now threatened.

### Multiple Culprits
| Actor | Role in Erosion |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Russia, China** | Long chafed at US rules, unwinding them as power grows |
| **Endangered democracies** | Choosing buffer zones over international law |
| **Globalization** | Excesses destroyed WTO; predatory China behavior |
| **United States** | Recalculating whether order serves its interest |

### Trump's Strategic Bet
Stephen Miller: "We live in a world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time."

Trump's calculation:
- More nakedly competitive world benefits the fiercest player
- US - with unmatched military and resource-rich hemisphere - will have greatest [[Spheres of Influence|sphere of influence]]
- If Washington can't afford to uphold order, seize largest share of the loot
- Pursuing mercantilist ends through [[Gunboat Diplomacy]]

### [[Predatory Hegemony]] (Stephen Walt)
[[Stephen Walt]] coined "predatory hegemony" to describe this approach:
- Traditional hegemony preys on **adversaries**
- Predatory hegemony preys on **everyone**, including allies
- "What's mine is mine, what's yours is negotiable"
- Works short-term against dependent allies
- Long-term failure as allies diversify and push back

### The [[Melian Dialogue]] Returns
Trump making the ancient Athenian ethos US policy:
> "The strong do what they will and the weak suffer what they must."

### Risks of the Bet
- Grabbing Greenland could fracture NATO
- Losing global legitimacy that lubricates American strength
- Post-liberal-order world may be less prosperous, less stable
- Even the US may eventually suffer

> "Trump is betting that American power and well-being will survive, even soar, after the demise of the US order. In typically Trumpian fashion, he won't be around to pay the price if the wager fails." — Hal Brands

### Structural, Not Personal (Poggio)
[[Carlos Gustavo Poggio]] argues this transcends Trump:
- "Donald Trump created a movement that can return to power at any moment"
- [[JD Vance]] "perhaps even more anti-European than Trump himself"
- Ideas that were marginal in US politics now at center of one major party
- "Europeans won't forget this"
- World is "reconfiguring for a United States playing a very different role than since end of WWII"

## Order Transition Scenarios

### 1. Liberal Order Adapts
- Accommodates rising powers
- Reforms institutions
- Maintains core principles
- Broader legitimacy

### 2. Contested Order
- No clear rules
- Regional spheres
- Great power competition
- Fragmentation

### 3. New Order Emerges
- China-led?
- Different principles
- Long transition
- Unclear outcome

### 4. Disorder
- Rules collapse
- Conflict increases
- Institutions fail
- Historical pattern?

## Historical Orders

| Era | Order | Character |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| 1648-1789 | Westphalian | Sovereign states, balance |
| 1815-1914 | Concert of Europe | Great power management |
| 1919-1939 | Versailles | Failed liberal attempt |
| 1945-1991 | Cold War | Bipolar, competing orders |
| 1991-2008? | Unipolar/Liberal | US hegemony, liberal rules |
| 2008-present | Transitional | Contested, fragmenting |

## Key Debates

### Can Order Survive Power Shift?
- Institutions as stabilizers?
- Or power determines order?

### Liberal Order for Whom?
- Western-centric?
- Universal or particular?
- Hypocrisy charges

### Reform or Replace?
- Adapt existing institutions?
- Build alternatives?
- Coexistence possible?
