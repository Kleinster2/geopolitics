# INF Treaty

## Overview
The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (1987-2019) was a landmark Cold War agreement that eliminated an entire category of nuclear weapons. Signed by Reagan and Gorbachev, it banned all ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500-5,500 km. US withdrew in 2019 citing Russian violations, completing part of the arms control collapse.

## Key Facts

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Signed | December 8, 1987 (Washington) |
| Parties | United States, Soviet Union/Russia |
| Entered force | June 1, 1988 |
| US withdrawal | August 2, 2019 |
| Missiles destroyed | 2,692 (by June 1991) |

## What It Banned

### Covered Systems
- Ground-launched ballistic missiles: 500-5,500 km range
- Ground-launched cruise missiles: 500-5,500 km range
- Launchers for such missiles

### Why This Range?
- Intermediate-range missiles in Europe could strike Soviet/European targets in minutes
- Too fast for meaningful warning or decision time
- Destabilized deterrence - "use them or lose them" pressure
- Removing them enhanced crisis stability

## Historical Significance

### First of Its Kind
- First treaty to eliminate entire category of nuclear weapons
- Not just limits - actual destruction
- Asymmetric reductions (Soviets destroyed more)
- Comprehensive verification regime

### Cold War Context
- Responded to Soviet SS-20 deployments in Europe (1977)
- NATO "dual-track" decision: deploy Pershing II while negotiating
- Massive European peace protests
- Breakthrough in Reagan-Gorbachev relationship

## Destruction Totals

| Side | Missiles Destroyed |
|------|-------------------|
| Soviet Union | 1,846 |
| United States | 846 |
| **Total** | **2,692** |

## Collapse (2014-2019)

### US Allegations
- 2014: US accused Russia of testing ground-launched cruise missile (SSC-8/9M729)
- Alleged violation of 500 km floor
- Russia denied, claimed missile compliant

### Russian Counter-Claims
- US Aegis Ashore in Romania could launch cruise missiles
- US armed drones violated spirit of treaty
- US withdrawal predetermined

### Withdrawal Sequence
- October 2018: Trump announces intent to withdraw
- February 2019: US formally suspends obligations
- August 2, 2019: US withdrawal effective
- Treaty terminated

## Consequences

### Immediate
- Both sides free to develop intermediate-range missiles
- Russia already had SSC-8 ready
- US began developing new systems

### Strategic
- Europe more vulnerable
- No constraints on ground-based missiles
- Part of broader arms control collapse
- Precedent for other withdrawals

### Current Relevance
- Russia deployed SSC-8 systems
- US developing Typhon missile system
- Deployments to Europe, Asia-Pacific discussed
- No prospect for replacement treaty
