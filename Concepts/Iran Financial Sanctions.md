# Iran Financial and Economic Sanctions

## Overview
The financial and economic sanctions on Iran constitute one of the most comprehensive economic warfare campaigns in history. By targeting Iran's banking system, oil exports, and access to the global dollar system, these sanctions have crippled the Iranian economy and contributed directly to the [[Iranian Economic Crisis]] and [[Iran Protests 2025-2026]].

## Core Mechanisms

### 1. SWIFT Disconnection

**What It Is:**
SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the messaging system banks use for international transfers. Cutting Iran off means Iranian banks cannot communicate with foreign banks for normal transactions.

**Timeline:**
| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| March 2012 | First disconnection (Obama) |
| January 2016 | Reconnected under JCPOA |
| November 2018 | Disconnected again (Trump) |
| 2025-26 | Remains cut off |

**Impact:**
- Cannot process normal international payments
- Must use intermediaries, workarounds
- Transaction costs increase dramatically
- Trade becomes difficult/expensive
- Foreign partners avoid Iran entirely

**Banks Affected:**
- [[Central Bank of Iran]]
- [[Bank Melli Iran]]
- [[Bank Mellat]]
- [[Bank Saderat Iran]]
- Most other Iranian banks

### 2. Dollar Denial

**What It Is:**
Iran is excluded from the US dollar financial system:
- Cannot hold accounts at US banks
- Cannot clear dollar transactions
- Cannot access dollar funding markets
- Dollar-denominated contracts unenforceable

**Why It Matters:**
- Dollar is ~60% of global reserves
- ~40% of international payments in dollars
- Oil traditionally priced in dollars
- Most international trade uses dollars
- Being cut off is like losing oxygen

**Workarounds Iran Uses:**
- Euro (limited, EU banks cautious)
- Yuan (China trade)
- Rupee (India, limited)
- Barter (oil for goods)
- Gold
- Cryptocurrency (limited success)

### 3. Central Bank Sanctions

The [[Central Bank of Iran]] is directly sanctioned:

**Restrictions:**
- Assets frozen in US jurisdiction
- Cannot transact with US financial system
- Foreign banks face penalties for CBI dealings
- Reserves largely inaccessible

**Impact:**
- Cannot defend currency through intervention
- Cannot access foreign exchange reserves
- Cannot conduct normal central banking
- Forced to print money → inflation

### 4. Correspondent Banking Cutoff

**What It Is:**
Major international banks refuse to process any Iran-related transactions, even legal ones:
- Fear of US penalties
- Compliance costs too high
- Reputational risk
- "De-risking" easier than compliance

**Result:**
Even humanitarian trade (medicine, food) is difficult because banks won't process payments.

## Oil and Energy Sanctions

### Oil Export Restrictions

**Mechanism:**
- Buyers of Iranian oil face US secondary sanctions
- Must get waivers (rare, temporary)
- Insurance companies won't cover Iranian oil shipments
- Shipping companies avoid Iranian cargo

**Impact on Production:**

| Period | Production (bpd) |
|--------|------------------|
| Pre-2012 | ~4 million |
| 2012-2015 | ~2.5 million |
| 2016-2018 (JCPOA) | ~3.8 million |
| 2019-2020 | ~2 million |
| 2025 | <2 million (estimated) |

**Revenue Impact:**
Oil is 60-70% of government revenue. Cutting exports in half devastates the budget.

### Petrochemical Sanctions
- Petrochemical exports also sanctioned
- Second-largest export after crude
- Same secondary sanctions mechanism

### Energy Investment Ban
- Foreign companies cannot invest in Iranian oil/gas
- Technology transfer blocked
- Existing projects abandoned (Total, Shell)
- Infrastructure deteriorating

## Trade and Commercial Sanctions

### Import Restrictions
Iran cannot easily import:
- Technology (dual-use restrictions)
- Industrial equipment
- Automotive parts
- Aircraft/parts (safety concerns)
- Many consumer goods

### Export Restrictions
Iranian goods face:
- Tariffs
- Import bans in some countries
- Difficulty getting payment
- Shipping/insurance problems

### Rial Non-Convertibility
The Iranian rial is not freely convertible:
- Cannot exchange on international markets
- Black market rates diverge from official
- Creates economic distortions
- Businesses cannot plan

## Secondary Sanctions

### How They Work
US penalizes non-US entities that deal with Iran:

```
Non-US company deals with Iran
           ↓
US discovers transaction
           ↓
Company faces:
- Fines (billions of dollars)
- Loss of US market access
- Exclusion from dollar system
- Reputational damage
```

### Major Enforcement Cases

| Company | Year | Penalty | Violation |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| BNP Paribas | 2014 | $8.9 billion | Sudan, Cuba, Iran transactions |
| HSBC | 2012 | $1.9 billion | Iran, Mexico transactions |
| Standard Chartered | 2012 | $667 million | Iran transactions |
| Commerzbank | 2015 | $1.45 billion | Iran, Sudan transactions |

These cases terrified the global banking industry. Now most banks won't touch anything Iran-related.

### European Frustration
EU created INSTEX (2019) to bypass US sanctions for humanitarian trade:
- Largely failed
- Banks still wouldn't participate
- Too small scale
- US pressure too strong

## Cumulative Economic Impact

### Banking System
- [[Ayandeh Bank]] collapse ($5B losses)
- Five other banks fragile
- Self-dealing and corruption exposed
- Depositor confidence destroyed

### Currency
| Year | Rial/Dollar (approx) |
|------|---------------------|
| 2015 | 30,000 |
| 2018 | 45,000 |
| 2020 | 250,000 |
| 2025 | 600,000+ |
| 2026 | Historic lows |

### Inflation
- Food: 72% annual (2025)
- Overall: 40-50%+ officially (likely higher)
- Purchasing power down 90% over 8 years

### GDP
- Contracted ~6% in 2018-2019
- Stagnant or declining since
- Per capita income collapsed

### Capital Flight
- $10-20 billion left Iran in 2025 alone
- Wealthy Iranians moving assets out
- Brain drain accelerating

## Sanctions vs. Regime Survival

### What Sanctions Have Achieved
- Delayed nuclear breakout
- Imposed massive economic costs
- Limited funding for proxies
- Created conditions for current protests
- Weakened regime legitimacy

### What Sanctions Have Not Achieved
- Regime change
- Nuclear program abandonment
- End to regional activities
- Behavior change on core issues

### The 2026 Moment
Sanctions alone didn't break the regime, but combined with:
- Israeli military strikes (2025)
- IRGC decapitation
- Proxy network degradation
- Banking collapse
- Accumulated grievances

...they created conditions for the most serious threat to the Islamic Republic since 1979.

## Humanitarian Concerns

### Exemptions (Theoretical)
US sanctions technically exempt:
- Food
- Medicine
- Medical devices
- Humanitarian goods

### Reality
- Banks won't process even exempt transactions
- "Chilling effect" broader than legal restrictions
- Medicine shortages documented
- Medical equipment hard to import
- Ordinary Iranians suffer most

### Ethical Debate
Critics argue comprehensive economic sanctions:
- Punish civilians, not leaders
- Leaders insulated from suffering
- Collective punishment concerns
- May strengthen regime (rally effect)

Supporters argue:
- Preferable to military action
- Targeted sanctions reduce harm
- Regime's choices cause suffering
- No good alternatives
