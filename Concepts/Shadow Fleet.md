# Shadow Fleet

## Definition
A network of aging tankers operating outside mainstream commercial shipping to transport oil in violation of international sanctions. Vessels typically lack proper insurance, use deceptive practices to obscure cargo origins, and operate under flags of convenience.

## Origins
The term gained prominence after 2022 when Russia built up a fleet to circumvent Western sanctions following the Ukraine invasion. Similar practices existed earlier with Iran and Venezuela.

## Scale

### Russian Shadow Fleet (2022-present)
- Estimated 600+ vessels as of 2025
- Carries majority of Russian seaborne crude
- Built rapidly through purchases of aging tankers
- Often over 15-20 years old

### Iranian Fleet
- Developed over decade of sanctions
- Ship-to-ship transfers common
- AIS manipulation widespread

### Venezuelan Fleet
- Smaller scale
- Often uses Russian/Iranian vessels
- PDVSA-controlled tankers

## Operational Tactics

### Deceptive Practices
- **AIS manipulation**: Turning off transponders, spoofing locations
- **Ship-to-ship transfers**: Moving cargo at sea to obscure origin
- **Flag hopping**: Changing registry to avoid scrutiny
- **Document fraud**: Falsifying cargo origins

### Insurance Gaps
- No Western P&I Club coverage
- Russian or unknown insurers
- Unclear liability in accidents
- Environmental risk concentrated in coastal states

### Flagging
Common flags of convenience:
- Gabon
- Cameroon
- Palau
- Cook Islands
- Liberia (some)

## G-7 Price Cap Response

### Mechanism (December 2022)
- Western services (insurance, shipping, finance) only available if oil sold below $60/barrel
- Aimed to maintain Russian supply while limiting revenue
- Shadow fleet emerged as primary evasion route

### Effectiveness Debate
- Russia initially sold below cap, shadow fleet unnecessary
- As oil prices rose, shadow fleet enabled above-cap sales
- By 2024-2025, majority of Russian crude moved outside cap system

## Environmental and Safety Risks

### Aging Vessels
- Average age 15-20+ years
- Deferred maintenance
- Single-hull designs (banned in Western trade)

### Insurance Gaps
- No cleanup liability coverage
- Coastal states bear spill costs
- Limited salvage capacity

### Incidents
- Several groundings and near-misses in Baltic and Danish straits
- Estonia, Finland, Denmark expressing alarm
- No major spills yet (as of January 2026)

## Western Countermeasures

### Sanctions on Vessels
- US/UK/EU sanctioning individual ships
- 50+ vessels designated by 2025
- Impact limited by fleet size

### Port Restrictions
- Some ports refusing shadow fleet entry
- Enforcement inconsistent

### Insurance Focus
- Targeting intermediary insurers
- Pressure on flag states

### Challenges
- Hard to track fleet movements
- Flag states uncooperative
- Secondary market for services (China, India, UAE)

## Strategic Implications

### For Sanctioned States
- Demonstrates sanctions adaptation
- Raises costs but doesn't stop exports
- Shifts trade toward willing buyers (China, India)

### For Sanctions Regime
- Questions effectiveness of oil sanctions
- Requires constant adaptation
- "Whack-a-mole" enforcement problem

### For Maritime Order
- Erosion of shipping norms
- Insurance system stress
- Environmental externalities
