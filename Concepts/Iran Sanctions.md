# Iran Sanctions

## Overview
Iran is one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world, subject to overlapping US, EU, and UN restrictions targeting its nuclear program, support for terrorism, human rights violations, and missile development. Sanctions are central to understanding the [[Iranian Economic Crisis]] and the weakness of the regime during the [[Iran Protests 2025-2026]].

## Timeline

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1979 | US sanctions begin after hostage crisis |
| 1995 | Clinton expands to trade/investment ban |
| 2006 | UN Security Council sanctions (nuclear) |
| 2010 | Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Act (CISADA) |
| 2012 | SWIFT cutoff, oil sanctions intensify |
| 2015 | [[JCPOA]] - sanctions relief for nuclear limits |
| 2018 | Trump withdraws from JCPOA, "maximum pressure" |
| 2020 | Continued escalation |
| 2025-26 | Sanctions remain, economy collapses |

## Sanctions Architecture

### US Sanctions

**Primary Programs:**
| Program | Authority | Targets |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Nuclear | INRA, NDAA | Nuclear-related entities |
| Terrorism | IEEPA, ISA | IRGC, Hezbollah support |
| Human rights | Magnitsky Act | Officials, security forces |
| Missiles | Various EOs | Ballistic missile program |

**Key Designations:**
- [[IRGC]] - Designated as Foreign Terrorist Organization (2019)
- [[Central Bank of Iran]] - Sanctioned
- [[Bank Melli Iran]], [[Bank Mellat]], [[Bank Saderat Iran]] - Sanctioned
- [[Quds Force]] - Sanctioned
- Senior officials, commanders - Individually sanctioned

**Secondary Sanctions:**
US penalizes non-US entities that deal with Iran:
- Foreign banks risk losing US access
- Companies must choose between Iran and US market
- Creates extraterritorial reach
- Major deterrent for European/Asian companies

### EU Sanctions
- Nuclear-related restrictions
- Human rights designations
- Arms embargo
- Less extraterritorial than US
- Some legal challenges succeeded ([[Bank Mellat]])

### UN Sanctions
- Security Council resolutions (2006-2015)
- Partially lifted under JCPOA
- Limited scope (P5 consensus required)
- China/Russia block expansion

## Key Mechanisms

See [[Iran Financial Sanctions]] for detailed analysis of economic warfare mechanisms.

### SWIFT Cutoff
Iranian banks largely disconnected from SWIFT international payment messaging:
- Cannot process normal international transfers
- Must use workarounds, intermediaries
- Dramatically increases transaction costs
- Effectively cuts Iran from global finance

**History:**
- 2012: First cutoff (Obama administration)
- 2015: Reconnected under JCPOA
- 2018: Cut off again (Trump withdrawal)

### Oil Sanctions
Iran's main revenue source targeted:
- Buyers face US secondary sanctions
- Must get waivers (rare under Trump)
- Forces discounted sales to China/India
- Production collapsed from 4M to <2M bpd

### Dollar Denial
Iran cannot access US dollar system:
- Cannot hold dollar accounts at US banks
- Cannot clear dollar transactions
- Must use alternative currencies (yuan, euro, barter)
- Rial not freely convertible

## JCPOA and Sanctions Relief (2015-2018)

### What Was Lifted
Under the nuclear deal:
- Secondary sanctions on oil suspended
- Banking access partially restored
- SWIFT reconnected
- Asset unfreezing

### What Remained
Even under JCPOA:
- Terrorism designations stayed
- Human rights sanctions stayed
- Missile sanctions stayed
- Primary US sanctions (US persons banned)

### Why Relief Failed to Transform Economy
- Remaining sanctions deterred banks
- "Sanctions snapback" risk
- Short window (2016-2018)
- European banks still cautious
- Then Trump withdrew

## Maximum Pressure (2018-2021)

Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign:
- Withdrew from JCPOA (May 2018)
- Reimposed all sanctions
- Added new designations
- Zero oil export goal
- IRGC designated terrorist organization

**Impact:**
- Oil exports crashed
- GDP contracted ~6% (2018-2019)
- Rial lost 60%+ value
- Inflation spiked
- But: No regime collapse, no policy change

## Sanctions Evasion

### China Connection
- Primary oil buyer despite sanctions
- Uses yuan, barter arrangements
- Chinese banks avoid dollar system
- Discounted oil benefits China

### Russia Channel
- Growing cooperation post-2022
- Shared sanctions experience
- Alternative payment systems
- Defense cooperation

### Traditional Methods
- Ship-to-ship oil transfers (dark fleet)
- Front companies
- Mislabeling cargo origins
- Cryptocurrency (limited)
- Hawala/informal transfers

## Impact Assessment

### Economic
| Indicator | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| GDP | Contracted significantly |
| Oil exports | Down 75%+ from peak |
| Currency | Rial lost 84% in 2025 alone |
| Inflation | 72% food price inflation |
| Banking | [[Ayandeh Bank]] collapse, system fragile |

### Political
- No nuclear capitulation
- No regime change
- Hardliners strengthened (reformers discredited)
- Anti-American sentiment reinforced
- But: Regime now at weakest point since 1979

### Humanitarian
- Medicine shortages (despite exemptions)
- Food price inflation
- Middle class impoverished
- Brain drain accelerated
- Ordinary Iranians suffer most

## Current Status (January 2026)

### Sanctions Regime
- Full US sanctions in effect
- No JCPOA revival
- Trump 2.0 continuing pressure
- EU maintaining restrictions

### Effectiveness Debate
**Has worked:**
- Delayed nuclear breakout
- Imposed massive economic costs
- Contributed to regime weakness
- Limited proxy funding

**Has not worked:**
- No nuclear deal compliance
- No end to regional activities
- No regime change (yet)
- Humanitarian costs

### Connection to Protests
Sanctions created conditions for [[Iran Protests 2025-2026]]:
- Economic desperation
- Middle class wiped out
- Regime lost ability to buy off population
- Combined with military defeats and corruption scandals
