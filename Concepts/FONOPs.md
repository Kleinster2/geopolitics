# FONOPs (Freedom of Navigation Operations)

## Overview
US Navy operations that challenge excessive maritime claims by other nations. Ships and aircraft deliberately transit disputed waters to assert legal rights under international law. Primary tool for maintaining [[Freedom of Navigation]] and preventing creeping jurisdictional claims from becoming accepted.

## Purpose

### Assert Legal Rights
- Demonstrate that excessive claims are invalid
- Prevent acquiescence through silence
- Maintain navigational freedoms for all nations

### Prevent Fait Accompli
- If claims go unchallenged, they can become customary
- Regular transits prevent normalization of illegal restrictions
- "Use it or lose it" principle

### Signal Commitment
- Show allies US will defend open seas
- Deter adversaries from escalation
- Demonstrate resolve

## How They Work

### Operational Concept
1. Identify excessive maritime claim
2. Plan transit that exercises legal rights
3. Conduct passage in normal operational mode
4. Document the operation
5. Report to State Department

### Types of Challenges
| Claim Type | US Response |
|------------|-------------|
| Excessive territorial sea (>12nm) | Transit within claimed area |
| Prior notification required | Transit without notifying |
| Innocent passage restrictions | Exercise rights being restricted |
| Straight baseline abuse | Transit inside false baselines |
| EEZ military activity ban | Conduct exercises in EEZ |

### Key Distinction
FONOPs are **not** about showing force or intimidation. They are legal demonstrations - asserting rights that exist under [[UNCLOS]] and customary international law.

## South China Sea FONOPs

### Frequency
- Multiple per year (increased under Trump 1.0)
- Continued under Biden
- Ongoing under Trump 2.0
- Regular and publicized

### Targets
- Paracel Islands (China)
- Spratly Islands (China, others)
- Mischief Reef (artificial island)
- Scarborough Shoal
- Various excessive claims

### China's Response
- Denounces as "provocations"
- Shadows with warships
- Issues verbal warnings
- Occasional dangerous maneuvers
- No physical interference (so far)

### 2016 Arbitration
- Tribunal ruled against China's claims
- China rejected ruling
- FONOPs reinforce legal position
- But China continues building

## Taiwan Strait Transits

### The Dispute
- China claims Taiwan Strait as internal waters
- US asserts international strait status
- Transits demonstrate legal position

### Operations
- Regular US Navy transits
- Often with allied ships
- Beijing protests each time
- No physical interference

### Significance
- Tests China's red lines
- Reassures Taiwan
- Maintains precedent
- High symbolic value

## Global FON Program

### Scope
- Challenges 65+ countries' excessive claims
- Not just adversaries (allies too)
- Annual State Department report
- Decades-old program

### Countries Challenged
Not just China - includes:
- Iran (Strait of Hormuz claims)
- Venezuela (excessive claims)
- Philippines (archipelagic issues)
- India (prior notification)
- Many others

### Impartiality
Challenging allies' claims too maintains:
- Legal consistency
- Credibility
- Non-political character
- Universal application

## Risks and Tensions

### Escalation Potential
- Close encounters at sea
- Dangerous maneuvers
- Miscalculation risk
- CUES protocol helps (Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea)

### Incidents
- 2018: Chinese destroyer came within 45 yards of USS Decatur
- Regular unsafe intercepts by Chinese aircraft
- Verbal warnings and challenges
- No shots fired (yet)

### Managing Risk
- Professional naval conduct
- Communication channels
- De-escalation protocols
- Command authority limits

## Effectiveness Debate

### Supporters Say
- Maintains legal precedent
- Deters creeping jurisdiction
- Reassures allies
- Low cost, high value

### Critics Say
- Doesn't change China's behavior
- Risks escalation
- Symbolic rather than substantive
- China still building islands

### Reality
- FONOPs alone won't resolve disputes
- But abandoning them would concede claims
- Part of broader strategy, not solution itself

## 2026 Context

With [[Freedom of Navigation]] under pressure globally:
- South China Sea remains primary theater
- Red Sea operations against Houthis
- Taiwan Strait transits continue
- Arctic routes emerging as new arena
