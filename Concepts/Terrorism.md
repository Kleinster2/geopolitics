# Terrorism

## Overview
Use of violence by non-state actors against civilians to achieve political objectives through fear. Dominated US foreign policy post-9/11. Now reduced priority as great power competition returns, though threats persist. Evolved from al-Qaeda centralized model to dispersed, inspired attacks. Definitions contested and politically charged.
