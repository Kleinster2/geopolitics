# Anti-Coercion Instrument

## Overview
EU trade defense tool designed to counter economic coercion by foreign powers against member states. Goes beyond traditional tariff retaliation - can restrict market access for foreign companies. Colloquially called EU's trade "bazooka" or "anti-bullying instrument" (origin of "bazooka" term unclear - emerged organically in EU policy/media circles).

## Purpose
Defend EU member states subjected to tariff or trade pressure by foreign powers for political reasons.

## Key Features

### Beyond Tariffs
Unlike traditional counter-tariffs (e.g., targeting Harley-Davidson), the ACI can:
- Restrict market access for major companies (e.g., Alphabet/Google)
- Impose non-tariff barriers
- Limit services access
- Restrict investment

### Scope
- Explicitly designed for situations where trade measures are used as political coercion
- Can target tech giants and major multinationals
- Represents escalation beyond tit-for-tat tariffs
- Per Braga: could include intellectual property restrictions, market access limits for US companies (e.g., communications sector)

## Context

### Adoption
- Entered into force December 2023
- Part of EU's shift toward "open strategic autonomy"
- Response to rising use of economic coercion globally
- **Never been used** as of January 2026 (per [[Carlos Primo Braga]])

### First Potential Use: Greenland Crisis (2026)
Trump's tariff threats against EU countries sending troops to Greenland triggered calls to deploy the ACI:
- France's Macron favors using it
- VDMA (German industrial association) backs deployment
- Would represent first major test of the instrument

## Significance
- Signals EU willingness to use economic tools defensively
- Targets where it hurts: market access for US tech/services giants
- Bigger leverage than traditional goods tariffs
- Part of EU's geoeconomic toolkit alongside [[Sanctions]]
