# Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)

## Overview
Bans all nuclear explosions, anywhere, by anyone. Opened for signature 1996 but never entered into force due to non-ratification by key states. Despite this, it has established a de facto global norm against testing - no state except North Korea has tested since 1998.

## Key Provisions

### The Ban
- Prohibits all nuclear explosions
- Military or civilian purposes
- Any environment (atmosphere, underwater, underground, space)
- Any yield (no threshold)

### Verification
- International Monitoring System (IMS)
- On-site inspections (once in force)
- Consultation and clarification
- Confidence-building measures

## Entry Into Force Problem

### Annex 2 States
Treaty requires ratification by 44 specific states with nuclear technology. Eight have not ratified:

| State | Status | Obstacle |
|-------|--------|----------|
| United States | Signed, not ratified | Senate rejected 1999 |
| China | Signed, not ratified | Waiting for US |
| Israel | Signed, not ratified | Security concerns |
| Iran | Signed, not ratified | Nuclear program |
| Egypt | Signed, not ratified | Israel linkage |
| India | Not signed | Opposes treaty |
| Pakistan | Not signed | Follows India |
| North Korea | Not signed | Nuclear weapons state |

Until all 44 ratify, treaty cannot enter into force.

### US Rejection (1999)
- Clinton administration signed (1996)
- Senate rejected 51-48 (1999)
- Concerns: verification, stockpile reliability
- No subsequent attempt
- Obama supported but never submitted

## International Monitoring System

Operating despite treaty not in force:

### Station Types

| Type | Number | Detection |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Seismic | 170 | Underground explosions |
| Hydroacoustic | 11 | Underwater explosions |
| Infrasound | 60 | Atmospheric explosions |
| Radionuclide | 80 | Radioactive particles |

### Capabilities
- Detected all North Korean tests
- Sub-kiloton detection possible
- Global coverage
- Real-time data transmission
- Also useful for: earthquakes, tsunamis, volcano monitoring

### International Data Centre
- Vienna headquarters
- Processes monitoring data
- Distributes to member states
- 24/7 operation

## Testing History

### Pre-CTBT
- Over 2,000 nuclear tests (1945-1996)
- US: 1,032 tests
- USSR/Russia: 715 tests
- France: 210 tests
- UK: 45 tests
- China: 45 tests

### Post-CTBT (1996-present)
Only North Korea has tested:
- 2006: ~1 kt
- 2009: ~2-6 kt
- 2013: ~6-16 kt
- 2016 (Jan): Claimed H-bomb, likely boosted fission
- 2016 (Sep): ~10-30 kt
- 2017: ~100-370 kt (likely thermonuclear)

## De Facto Norm

Despite not entering force:
- Major powers observe moratorium
- Testing seen as provocative
- Only North Korea has broken norm
- Strong international condemnation when violated

### Why Observe Without Legal Force?
- Simulation technology improved
- Stockpile stewardship programs
- Reputational costs of testing
- Don't need tests for reliability

## Current Debates

### Revival Prospects
- Unlikely in current environment
- US ratification politically impossible
- China-US tensions
- Would require geopolitical shift

### Testing Resumption Fears
- Russia: 2023 revoked ratification (symbolic)
- China: Suspected low-yield tests (unconfirmed)
- US: Maintains readiness to resume
- North Korea: May test again

### Russia's De-Ratification (2023)
- October 2023: Duma revoked ratification
- Putin signed
- Symbolic - treaty never in force anyway
- Signal of deteriorating arms control
- Russia claims still observing moratorium

## Significance

### Arms Control Architecture
- Part of broader framework
- Linked to NPT Article VI
- Complements fissile material controls
- Verification precedent

### Technical Barrier
- Testing needed for new designs
- Limits nuclear modernization
- Especially constrains new nuclear states
- Reason India/Pakistan oppose
