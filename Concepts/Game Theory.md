# Game Theory

## Overview
Mathematical study of strategic interaction—how rational actors make decisions when outcomes depend on others' choices. Foundational to modern security studies, economics, and understanding conflict and cooperation in international relations.

## Core Concepts

### Players, Strategies, Payoffs
- **Players**: Decision-makers (states, leaders, firms)
- **Strategies**: Available choices
- **Payoffs**: Outcomes (utility, security, profit)

### Key Game Types

| Game | Structure | IR Application |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Prisoner's Dilemma** | Individual rationality → collective suboptimality | Arms races, trade wars, climate |
| **Chicken** | Both prefer not to crash, but neither wants to swerve first | Brinkmanship, crises |
| **Stag Hunt** | Cooperation optimal but risky | Alliances, collective security |
| **Assurance** | Coordination with mutual benefit | Arms control, institutions |

### Equilibrium Concepts
- **Nash Equilibrium**: No player can improve by unilaterally changing strategy
- **Dominant Strategy**: Best choice regardless of others' actions
- **Pareto Optimality**: No one can be made better off without making someone worse off

## Applications to Security

### Deterrence
Game-theoretic foundation: threat must make aggression's expected payoff negative. [[Thomas Schelling]] applied bargaining theory to nuclear strategy.

### Arms Races
Prisoner's dilemma: both prefer mutual disarmament, but each fears being unarmed if other arms. Individual rationality produces collective insecurity.

### Crises
Chicken game: both prefer backing down to war, but neither wants to back down first. Manipulation of risk, commitment devices, brinkmanship.

### Alliances
Assurance/coordination games: allies must coordinate responses, free-rider problems, burden-sharing debates.

## Limitations in IR

### Rationality Assumptions
Game theory assumes rational, utility-maximizing actors. But:
- Leaders face domestic constraints, cognitive biases
- States aren't unitary actors
- Information is incomplete, preferences unclear

### Static vs. Dynamic
Basic games are one-shot. Real interactions are repeated, with learning, reputation, evolving relationships.

### Modeling Choices
Results depend heavily on how game is structured. Different framings yield different equilibria—raises question of which model applies.

### Incomplete Information
Real actors don't know others' payoffs, resolve, or capabilities. Signaling and screening games address this but add complexity.

## Key Thinkers

### Founders
- **John von Neumann** - *Theory of Games and Economic Behavior* (1944)
- **John Nash** - Nash equilibrium (Nobel 1994)

### Security Applications
- [[Thomas Schelling]] - Bargaining, focal points, commitment (Nobel 2005)
- **Robert Axelrod** - Evolution of cooperation, iterated prisoner's dilemma
- **James Fearon** - Rationalist explanations for war

## Contemporary Use

### Formal Models
Academic security studies uses game theory to:
- Model deterrence stability
- Analyze alliance dynamics
- Study crisis bargaining
- Explain war onset and duration

### Policy Analysis
Less formal application in:
- Scenario planning
- Red-teaming
- Strategic assessment
