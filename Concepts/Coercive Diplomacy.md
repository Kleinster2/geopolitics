# Coercive Diplomacy

## Overview
Using threats or limited force to persuade an adversary to change course, combined with diplomacy offering a way out. Sits between pure diplomacy and war—backing demands with credible military pressure while leaving room for negotiated settlement.

## Core Elements

### The Carrot and Stick
Coercive diplomacy combines:
1. **Threat/pressure**: Military deployments, demonstrations, limited strikes, sanctions
2. **Demands**: Clear statement of what adversary must do
3. **Off-ramp**: Face-saving exit, incentives for compliance

Without credible force, it's just diplomacy. Without diplomacy, it's just coercion.

### Requirements for Success
- **Credibility**: Adversary must believe you'll follow through
- **Capability**: Means to impose costs that exceed adversary's stakes
- **Clear demands**: Adversary must know what compliance looks like
- **Acceptable terms**: Demands must be achievable, not total capitulation
- **Urgency**: Deadlines or escalating pressure

## Relationship to Other Concepts

| Concept | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| [[Deterrence]] | Prevents action; coercive diplomacy changes behavior |
| [[Compellence]] | The threat component of coercive diplomacy |
| [[Escalation]] | Tool and risk of coercive diplomacy |
| [[Brinkmanship]] | Extreme form—manipulating shared risk of war |

## Success and Failure

### When It Works
- Adversary's stakes are limited
- Costs imposed are high and credible
- Face-saving exit available
- Demands are proportionate

### When It Fails
- Adversary's stakes are existential
- Threats not credible (will you really go to war?)
- Demands humiliating or unlimited
- Adversary can absorb costs
- Domestic politics trap adversary

## Historical Cases

### Successes
- **Cuban Missile Crisis (1962)**: US blockade + threat of strikes + secret deal on Turkey missiles → Soviet withdrawal
- **Libya WMD (2003)**: Sanctions + Iraq demonstration effect + diplomatic engagement → Qaddafi surrendered nuclear program

### Failures
- **Iraq 1990-2003**: Sanctions, no-fly zones, inspections never achieved regime compliance on WMD (which didn't exist)
- **North Korea**: Decades of pressure, negotiations, sanctions → North Korea now has nuclear weapons
- **Iran 2018-present**: Maximum pressure campaign failed to force new nuclear deal or regime change

### Mixed
- **Kosovo 1999**: NATO bombing eventually forced Serbian withdrawal, but took 78 days—coercion worked but diplomacy failed to avoid war

## Contemporary Applications

### US-China
- Taiwan: US military presence, arms sales, strategic ambiguity as coercive posture
- Trade: Tariffs as coercive tool (limited success)
- Technology: Export controls as economic coercion

### Russia-West
- Ukraine weapons transfers: Calibrated to pressure Russia without triggering escalation
- Sanctions: Attempting to coerce Russian policy change (limited effect so far)

### Iran
- Sanctions, military threats, sabotage combined with diplomatic offers
- Neither maximum pressure nor JCPOA achieved durable outcome

## Risks

### Escalation
Coercive diplomacy can spiral—each side increases pressure, off-ramps close, war becomes likely.

### Credibility Trap
If you threaten and don't follow through, credibility suffers. But following through may be costly or counterproductive.

### Adversary Misreads
Coercer may underestimate adversary's resolve; adversary may underestimate coercer's. Miscalculation leads to war.
