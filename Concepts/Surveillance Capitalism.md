# Surveillance Capitalism

## Definition

A term coined by [[Shoshana Zuboff]] (Harvard Business School, 2014; book 2019) for the economic logic in which tech companies extract and commodify behavioral data from users, using it to predict and modify behavior for profit. Not simply "companies collecting data" but a new form of market that trades in human futures.

## Core Logic

Zuboff's framework identifies a three-step process:
1. **Extraction**: Harvest behavioral data from users (clicks, location, searches, social connections)
2. **Prediction**: Use data to build models of individual behavior
3. **Modification**: Sell predictions to advertisers/clients; nudge behavior toward desired outcomes

The key insight: surplus behavioral data beyond what's needed for service improvement is claimed as a free resource - a "behavioral surplus" converted into "prediction products."

## Historical Origins

Zuboff traces the system to specific policy choices:
- **Clinton-era internet policy**: Ceded governance functions to private companies
- **Post-9/11 surveillance expansion**: Government-tech partnership normalized mass data collection
- **Google's 2001 discovery**: Surplus behavioral data could predict ad clicks - invented the business model
- **2008 smartphone revolution**: Extended extraction to physical world (location, movement, biometrics)

## Geopolitical Dimensions

### Concentration of Power
- Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple control most of the world's behavioral data
- All US-headquartered (or US-market-dominant)
- Creates asymmetric knowledge: these firms know more about foreign populations than foreign governments do

### Alternatives (Not Necessarily Better)
- **China's model**: Same extraction, but state is the primary client (social credit, surveillance state)
- **EU's regulatory response**: GDPR, DSA attempt to limit extraction without banning the model
- Neither eliminates surveillance - they redistribute who benefits from it

### Global South as Data Source
- Populations provide behavioral data
- Value captured by US/Chinese firms
- Limited local capacity to regulate or benefit
- See [[Digital Colonialism]]

## Relationship to State Surveillance

Zuboff distinguishes surveillance capitalism from state surveillance:
- State surveillance: Power through knowledge of citizens
- Surveillance capitalism: Profit through knowledge of consumers
- But: the two systems are **symbiotic** - states access corporate data; corporations benefit from state infrastructure

The Snowden revelations (2013) exposed the depth of this relationship (NSA accessing Google, Facebook data via PRISM).

## Critiques of Zuboff

- **Overstates novelty**: Advertising has always tried to predict behavior; this is a difference of degree, not kind
- **Understates user agency**: People choose to use these services, often knowingly
- **Marxist critique**: Zuboff focuses on data extraction but ignores exploitation of labor in the supply chain
- **Technological determinism**: Implies the business model is inevitable rather than a policy choice
- **Solutions unclear**: Zuboff calls for regulation but doesn't specify what would replace the model
