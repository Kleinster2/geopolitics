# Cyber Warfare

## Definition
The use of digital attacks by states or state-sponsored actors against another state's computer systems, networks, and infrastructure for espionage, sabotage, or coercion. A new domain of conflict alongside land, sea, air, and space.

## Characteristics

### Unique Features
- **Attribution difficulty**: Hard to prove attacker identity
- **Asymmetry**: Weak actors can harm strong ones
- **Low cost**: Relatively cheap vs. kinetic operations
- **Speed**: Near-instantaneous
- **Dual-use**: Same tools for crime and warfare
- **Persistent engagement**: Constant probing/operations

### Challenges
- Defining "act of war" threshold
- Deterrence difficulties
- Escalation dynamics unclear
- Civilian infrastructure targeting
- International law gaps

## Types of Cyber Operations

### Espionage
- Intelligence gathering
- Intellectual property theft
- Government/military secrets
- Most common state activity

### Sabotage
- Infrastructure disruption
- Industrial control system attacks
- Stuxnet as exemplar
- Physical damage potential

### Information Operations
- Election interference
- Disinformation campaigns
- Social media manipulation
- Public opinion influence

### Criminal (State-Sponsored)
- Ransomware
- Financial theft
- Sanctions evasion
- North Korea specialty

## Major State Actors

### Russia
- APT28/29 (Fancy Bear/Cozy Bear)
- Election interference (2016 US)
- NotPetya attack (2017)
- Ukraine cyber attacks
- SolarWinds compromise

### China
- APT groups (numerous)
- IP theft (massive scale)
- OPM hack (2015)
- Technology espionage
- Microsoft Exchange attacks

### United States
- NSA/Cyber Command
- Stuxnet (with Israel)
- Offensive capabilities (presumed)
- "Defend forward" doctrine
- Attribution/indictments

### North Korea
- Lazarus Group
- Financial theft ($1B+)
- Sony hack (2014)
- WannaCry ransomware
- Sanctions evasion

### Iran
- Shamoon attacks (Saudi Aramco)
- Financial sector attacks
- Regional targeting
- Retaliatory capability

## Notable Attacks

| Attack | Year | Attacker | Impact |
|--------|------|----------|--------|
| Stuxnet | 2010 | US/Israel | Iran nuclear damage |
| OPM | 2015 | China | 22M records stolen |
| DNC hack | 2016 | Russia | Election interference |
| NotPetya | 2017 | Russia | $10B+ global damage |
| SolarWinds | 2020 | Russia | US government compromise |
| Colonial Pipeline | 2021 | Criminal | US fuel disruption |

## Critical Infrastructure Targets
- Energy/power grid
- Financial systems
- Transportation
- Water/sewage
- Healthcare
- Communications
- Government systems

## Deterrence Challenges

### Attribution Problem
- Difficult to prove
- False flags possible
- Delays response
- Deniability

### Threshold Ambiguity
- What constitutes "attack"?
- When is response justified?
- Proportionality unclear
- Escalation risks

### Asymmetry
- Defense harder than offense
- Vulnerabilities everywhere
- Interconnected systems
- Constant evolution

## International Law

### Tallinn Manual
- Academic/legal analysis
- Applies existing law to cyber
- Not binding but influential

### Unresolved Issues
- Sovereignty in cyberspace
- Use of force threshold
- Civilian protection
- Attribution requirements
- Response proportionality

## Defense Approaches

### Technical
- Network defense
- Threat intelligence
- Incident response
- Zero trust architecture

### Organizational
- Information sharing
- Public-private partnership
- International cooperation
- Workforce development

### Strategic
- Defend forward (US)
- Deterrence by punishment
- Deterrence by denial
- Norms development
