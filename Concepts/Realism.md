# Realism

## Definition
A theoretical framework arguing that world politics is driven by competitive self-interest among states in an anarchic international system. States are the primary actors, and power is the main currency.

## Key Thinkers
- **Classical**: Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hans Morgenthau
- **Neorealism**: Kenneth Waltz
- **Offensive Realism**: John Mearsheimer
- **Defensive Realism**: Stephen Walt

## Core Principles
1. **Anarchy**: No world government exists to enforce rules
2. **Statism**: States are the primary actors
3. **Self-help**: States must ensure their own survival
4. **Power politics**: Military and economic power determine outcomes
5. **Rationality**: States act rationally to maximize security

## Variants

### Classical Realism
Human nature (lust for power) drives conflict.

### Structural/Neorealism (Waltz)
The anarchic *structure* of the system forces states to compete, regardless of human nature.

### Offensive Realism (Mearsheimer)
States maximize power and seek hegemony because security is never guaranteed.

### Defensive Realism (Walt)
States primarily seek security, not power; excessive expansion provokes balancing.

## Critiques
- Ignores role of institutions, norms, ideas
- Cannot explain cooperation (EU, NATO persistence)
- State-centric view misses non-state actors
- Poor at predicting specific outcomes
