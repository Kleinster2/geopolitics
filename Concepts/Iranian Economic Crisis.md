# Iranian Economic Crisis

## Overview
Iran is experiencing its deepest and longest economic crisis in modern history. Decades of sanctions, mismanagement, corruption, and recent military defeats have combined into a systemic collapse that triggered the [[Iran Protests 2025-2026]]. The crisis is structural, not cyclical—the regime cannot solve it with existing tools.

## Key Indicators (2025-2026)

| Metric | Figure | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Rial depreciation (2025) | **84%** against dollar | Al Jazeera |
| Food price inflation | **72%** annual rate | Al Jazeera |
| Purchasing power loss | **90%+** over 8 years | Economic analysis |
| Capital flight (2025) | **$10-20 billion** | Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, Virginia Tech |
| GDP | ~$400 billion (nominal, unreliable) | Various |

## Banking Crisis

See: [[Iranian Banking System]] for full analysis of structure and IRGC involvement.

### Ayandeh Bank Collapse (Late 2025)
The collapse of Ayandeh Bank was a key trigger for the December 2025 protests.

**Details:**
- **Losses**: ~$5 billion from bad loans
- **Cause**: Massive self-lending scheme
- **Central bank assessment**: "A Ponzi scheme"
- **Management**: Run by regime-affiliated individuals
- **Impact**: Exposed systemic weakness in financial sector

### Systemic Banking Fragility
- **Five other banks** reportedly in similar condition
- Weak lending practices across sector
- Reliance on money creation (printing)
- Years of sanctions pressure
- Regime cronies extracting value

### Why Banks Are Failing
1. **Self-dealing**: Regime-connected individuals lend to themselves
2. **Non-performing loans**: Businesses failing, can't repay
3. **Sanctions**: Cut off from international system
4. **Currency collapse**: Assets denominated in worthless rials
5. **Capital flight**: Depositors fleeing

## Currency Crisis

### Rial Collapse
The Iranian rial has been in freefall:

| Year | Trend |
|------|-------|
| 2018 | Sharp drop after JCPOA withdrawal |
| 2020-2024 | Continued erosion |
| 2025 | Lost **84%** of value |
| 2026 | Reached historic lows, triggering protests |

### Causes
- **Sanctions**: Block dollar access, oil revenues
- **Money printing**: Central bank financing deficits
- **Capital flight**: $10-20B left in 2025 alone
- **Loss of confidence**: Regime legitimacy eroding
- **Military defeats**: 2025 Israeli strikes accelerated flight

### Impact
- Imports become unaffordable
- Food prices spike (72% annual inflation)
- Middle class wiped out
- Businesses cannot operate
- Bazaaris (merchants) turn against regime

## Sanctions Architecture

### Current Sanctions
- **US**: Comprehensive since 2018 JCPOA withdrawal
- **EU**: Partial, some human rights measures
- **UN**: Limited, mostly nuclear-related

### Impact Channels
1. **Oil exports**: Cannot sell freely, must discount heavily
2. **Banking**: Cut off from SWIFT, dollar system
3. **Trade**: Cannot import freely
4. **Investment**: Foreign capital blocked
5. **Technology**: Cannot access advanced goods

### Sanctions Evasion
- Ship-to-ship transfers
- Front companies
- Cryptocurrency (limited)
- China/Russia channels
- Barter arrangements

## Structural Problems

### Mismanagement
Victoria Coates (Heritage) describes "10 years of deferred maintenance":
- State enterprises inefficient
- Subsidies distort economy
- IRGC controls major sectors (corruption)
- Brain drain accelerating
- Infrastructure decaying

### IRGC Economic Empire
The Revolutionary Guards control significant economic sectors:
- Construction
- Oil and gas
- Telecommunications
- Import/export
- Smuggling networks

This creates:
- Inefficiency (no competition)
- Corruption (self-dealing)
- Misallocation (political not economic logic)
- Resentment (private sector crowded out)

### Demographics
- Young population with no opportunities
- Educated but unemployed
- Cannot afford housing, marriage
- Emigration of skilled workers

## Government Response (2026)

### Emergency Measures
- **New Central Bank governor**: Abdolnasser Hemmati appointed
- **Food coupons**: Monthly system introduced January 2026
- **"Holiday" declaration**: Attempted to stop protests (failed)

### What They Cannot Do
- **Print their way out**: Would accelerate inflation
- **Borrow internationally**: Cut off from markets
- **Attract investment**: Sanctions + instability
- **Reform**: Would threaten regime control

## Connection to Protests

The economic crisis directly triggered [[Iran Protests 2025-2026]]:

1. **Ayandeh Bank collapse** exposed corruption
2. **Currency crash** made goods unaffordable
3. **Bazaaris** (regime's traditional base) turned
4. **Middle class** joined students
5. **Workers** (oil, truckers) struck

This is different from 2022 protests:
- 2022: Social/cultural grievances (hijab)
- 2025-26: **Economic survival** + accumulated grievances

## Prognosis

### Assessment
> "The Islamic Republic is dying. While it may suppress this round of protests, it will not emerge from 2026 with its authority, cohesion, or capacity preserved." — GIS Reports

### Why Problems Are Unsolvable
1. Sanctions won't lift without nuclear/behavior changes regime won't make
2. Structural corruption tied to regime survival
3. IRGC won't give up economic control
4. Money printing is only short-term tool
5. Brain drain accelerating

### Possible Trajectories
| Scenario | Likelihood | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Muddle through | Decreasing | Running out of tools |
| Regime collapse | Possible | Economic pressure + military weakness |
| China/Russia bailout | Limited | They have own problems, limited capacity |
| Sanctions relief | Unlikely | Would require major concessions |
