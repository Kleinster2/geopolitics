# Power Transition

## Overview
Theory that major wars are most likely when a rising power approaches parity with the dominant power. The transition period is dangerous because the rising power may challenge the existing order while the declining power may fight to preserve it. Central to understanding US-China competition and the concept of the [[Thucydides Trap]].

## The Theory

### Core Argument
A.F.K. Organski (1958): International system has a hierarchy with dominant power setting rules. Rising powers that are dissatisfied with the status quo may challenge the leader when they approach parity. This transition period is when major wars occur.

### Key Variables
1. **Power trajectory**: Rising vs. declining
2. **Power parity**: When challenger approaches leader
3. **Satisfaction**: Does rising power accept or reject existing order?
4. **Timing**: Transition creates window of danger

### The Dangerous Zone

```
Power
  ^
  |        Dominant Power
  |    ___________________
  |   /                   \___
  |  /     DANGER ZONE         \
  | /    (parity + transition)  \
  |/_____________________________|____> Time
     Rising Power
```

## Historical Cases

### Supporting Cases
| Transition | Outcome | War |
|------------|---------|-----|
| Germany vs. Britain (1900s-1914) | WWI | Yes |
| Germany vs. France/Britain (1930s) | WWII | Yes |
| USSR vs. US (1950s-80s) | Cold War | Near-misses |

### Peaceful Transitions
| Transition | Outcome | War |
|------------|---------|-----|
| US vs. Britain (1890s-1945) | Peaceful handoff | No |
| Japan vs. US (1980s-90s) | Japan stagnated | No |

### Key Insight
Not all transitions cause war—satisfaction with existing order matters. US accepted British-led order; Germany rejected it.

## US-China Application

### The Fit
- China: Rapidly rising power
- US: Dominant power, relative decline
- Approaching parity in some measures
- China dissatisfied with some rules (but not all)

### Complicating Factors
- Nuclear weapons raise war costs
- Economic interdependence
- China partially benefits from existing order
- Not clear China seeks to overturn everything

### Danger Signs
- Taiwan as potential trigger
- Technology competition intensifying
- Military modernization
- Ideological divergence

## Related Concepts

### [[Thucydides Trap]]
Graham Allison's framing: "When a rising power threatens to displace a ruling power, the resulting structural stress makes war likely." Based on Thucydides' analysis of Sparta-Athens conflict. 12 of 16 historical cases resulted in war.

### Hegemonic Stability Theory
Robert Gilpin: Hegemonic wars reshape the international order. Dominant power provides public goods; challenges emerge as power shifts.

### Preventive War
Temptation for declining power to fight while still stronger, before rising power completes transition. "Better to fight now than later."

### Commitment Problems
Both sides face credibility issues:
- Rising power: "We won't challenge you later"
- Declining power: "We won't attack you now"

Neither can credibly commit, making war rational.

## Critiques

### Determinism
- Not all transitions cause war
- Agency matters, not just structure
- Nuclear weapons changed calculus
- Satisfaction variable crucial but hard to measure

### Measurement
- What is "power"? GDP? Military? Technology?
- Parity in what dimension?
- When exactly is the "danger zone"?

### US-China Specifics
- China may not seek global hegemony
- Regional vs. global ambitions differ
- Economic interdependence unprecedented
- Both nuclear-armed

## Policy Implications

### For Declining Power (US)
- Accommodate or resist?
- Manage transition or fight it?
- Preserve core interests while allowing adjustment
- Avoid preventive war temptation

### For Rising Power (China)
- Reassure or assert?
- Patience vs. seizing opportunity
- Signal limited aims
- Avoid provoking preventive action

### Managing Transitions
- Communication, transparency
- Confidence-building measures
- Adjust institutions to reflect new realities
- Focus on shared interests
