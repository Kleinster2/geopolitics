# Great Power Competition

## Overview
Framework describing international politics as primarily shaped by rivalry among major powers for security, influence, and relative advantage. Since ~2017, US official doctrine designating strategic competition with China and Russia as the central organizing principle of foreign policy, displacing post-9/11 counterterrorism focus.

## The Concept

### Theoretical Roots
- [[Realism]]: Great powers are primary actors; competition is structural
- [[Balance of Power]]: States balance against threats
- [[Thucydides Trap]]: Rising powers challenge incumbents
- Zero-sum logic: One state's gain is another's loss

### What Makes a "Great Power"
- Military capability (especially nuclear, power projection)
- Economic weight
- Technological leadership
- Diplomatic influence
- Ability to shape regional/global order

### Current Great Powers
- **United States**: Incumbent hegemon
- **China**: Rising challenger
- **Russia**: Declining but nuclear-armed, revisionist
- **EU**: Economic power, limited strategic coherence
- **India**: Rising, not yet peer competitor

## US Policy Shift

### From Counterterrorism to Competition
- **2001-2016**: War on Terror as organizing framework
- **2017 NSS**: "Revisionist powers" (China, Russia) as primary threats
- **2018 NDS**: "Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern"
- **Bipartisan consensus**: Rare agreement on China challenge

### Implications
- Military modernization priorities shift
- Alliance focus (Indo-Pacific especially)
- Technology competition (semiconductors, AI)
- Economic security emphasis
- Reduced Middle East focus

## Domains of Competition

### Military
- Force posture, basing, capabilities
- Nuclear modernization
- Space and cyber domains
- [[Anti-Access Area Denial]] challenges
- Allied interoperability

### Economic
- Trade policy, tariffs
- Supply chain security
- Technology controls ([[Semiconductors]])
- Investment screening
- [[Sanctions]]

### Technological
- AI, quantum, biotech
- Standards-setting
- Talent competition
- R&D investment
- Export controls

### Ideological
- Governance models (democracy vs. authoritarianism)
- Information competition
- Narrative/legitimacy
- Human rights discourse

### Institutional
- UN reform/competition
- Alternative institutions (BRICS, AIIB)
- Development finance
- Rules and norms

## US-China Competition

### Structural Drivers
- [[Power Transition]]: China approaching US capabilities
- Geography: Taiwan, South China Sea
- Technology: AI, semiconductors
- Ideology: CCP vs. liberal order

### Key Flashpoints
- [[Taiwan]]: Most dangerous potential conflict
- South China Sea: Territorial disputes
- Trade/technology: Decoupling pressures
- Alliances: US strengthening vs. China courting

### Competitive Dynamics
- Action-reaction spirals
- Third-party alignment pressures
- Risk of miscalculation
- Some cooperation necessary (climate, pandemic)

## US-Russia Competition

### Different Character
- Russia: declining power, limited economic weight
- But: Nuclear arsenal, European geography, willing to use force
- [[Ukraine Crisis]] as defining contest
- Energy as weapon

### Dynamics
- NATO expansion grievances
- Hybrid warfare, interference
- Arms control collapse
- China-Russia alignment

## Critiques

### Overstatement
- Not everything is zero-sum
- Cooperation on global challenges necessary
- Risk of self-fulfilling prophecy
- Cold War 2.0 framing may be misleading

### Alternatives
- [[G-Zero]]: No one in charge
- Multipolarity: More complex than bipolar competition
- Issue-specific cooperation possible
- Global challenges require coordination

### Risks
- Escalation dynamics
- Alliance entrapment
- Militarization of policy
- Missed cooperation opportunities
