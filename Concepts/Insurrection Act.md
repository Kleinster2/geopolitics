# Insurrection Act

## Definition
US federal law (originally 1807) that allows the president to deploy active-duty military forces domestically to suppress civil disorder, insurrection, or rebellion. One of the few exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act's prohibition on domestic military deployment.

## Key Provisions
- President can deploy military to enforce federal law
- Military can conduct arrests, detain civilians
- No congressional approval required
- President has broad discretion on when conditions warrant invocation

## Historical Uses
- **Civil rights era**: Eisenhower deployed 101st Airborne to Little Rock (1957)
- **1992 LA riots**: George H.W. Bush deployed federal troops
- **Rarely invoked**: Most presidents avoid it

## 2020 Near-Invocation
Trump came close to invoking it during George Floyd protests:
- Defense Secretary Mark Esper and AG Bill Barr pushed back
- Both tried to redirect/distract Trump from going through with it
- Marked rare institutional resistance

## January 2026 Threats

### Minneapolis
Trump threatening invocation against anti-ICE protesters:
- DOJ investigating Minneapolis mayor and Minnesota governor
- Accusations of obstruction of justice
- Follows pattern of using federal power against local resistance

### Implications
- Would deploy active-duty military (e.g., 82nd Airborne) against American citizens
- Military could conduct arrests alongside ICE
- Service members deeply reluctant—goes against military ethos
- Would represent most dramatic politicization of military since civil rights era

### Institutional Resistance
Unlike 2020:
- No equivalent figures to push back
- Pentagon leadership may object but unclear how forcefully
- Chilling effect from Senator Mark Kelly prosecution
- Threats to drop officers in rank, lose retirement

## Civil-Military Relations
The Act highlights tension between:
- Presidential authority to maintain order
- Military's apolitical professional identity
- Posse Comitatus tradition
- Constitutional limits on executive power

Service members take oath to Constitution, not president. Using military as political enforcement tool fundamentally contradicts military culture and professional ethics.
