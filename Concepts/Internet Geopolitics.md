# Internet Geopolitics

## Definition

The study of how states, corporations, and international institutions compete for control over internet infrastructure, governance, and standards. Encompasses the political economy of digital networks, the tension between transnational connectivity and territorial sovereignty, and the emerging fragmentation of the global internet along geopolitical lines.

Distinct from [[Cyber Warfare]] (the use of digital attacks as weapons) and [[Information Warfare]] (content manipulation). Internet geopolitics concerns the *structure* of digital space: who builds it, who governs it, and whose rules apply.

## Key Frameworks

### Lessig's Four Modalities (1999)
[[Lawrence Lessig]] argued that cyberspace is regulated by four forces:
1. **Law** - Legislation and regulation
2. **Norms** - Community expectations
3. **Markets** - Economic incentives
4. **Architecture (Code)** - Technical design choices

His key insight: code is the most powerful regulator. Whoever writes the architecture sets the rules. This framework remains foundational for understanding how technical standards embed political values.

### Four Internets (O'Hara & Hall, 2018/2021)
Kieron O'Hara and Wendy Hall (University of Southampton) identified four competing governance visions:

| Model | Champion | Priority |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Silicon Valley Open | US (legacy) | Innovation, openness |
| Bourgeois | European Union | Privacy, rights, regulation |
| Authoritarian | China | State control, surveillance |
| Commercial/DC | US (current) | Market power, data extraction |

Published through CIGI, expanded with Vint Cerf into *Four Internets: Data, Geopolitics, and the Governance of Cyberspace* (Oxford, 2021).

### Networks vs. States (Mueller, 2010)
[[Milton Mueller]] identifies the structural tension between the internet's transnational architecture and the nation-state system. Four areas of conflict:
1. Intellectual property
2. Cybersecurity
3. Content regulation
4. Control of critical resources (DNS, IP addresses)

Mueller advocates "denationalized liberalism" - governance by transnational institutions rather than states.

### Techno-Blocs (Cambridge, 2025)
A 2025 article in *International Organization* identifies emerging geopolitical groupings defined by technology alignment:
- **US approach**: Unilateral action plus alliance-based blocs ("AI mercantilism")
- **EU approach**: Regulatory sovereignty, using market access to globalize standards

## Core Tensions

### Open vs. Sovereign Internet
The original internet was designed as borderless. States have reasserted control through:
- Filtering and censorship (China's Great Firewall, Russia's Sovereign Internet Law)
- Data localization requirements
- Platform regulation (EU's GDPR, Digital Services Act)
- Infrastructure control (submarine cable routing, 5G vendor selection)

See: [[Digital Sovereignty]], [[Splinternet]]

### Infrastructure Control
Physical layer increasingly contested:
- **Submarine cables**: Meta, Google, Microsoft, Amazon control 70%+ of used capacity. Chinese competitor HMN Technologies builds 20-30% cheaper. Four cable disruptions in Taiwan Strait (Jan-Feb 2025). FCC barred Chinese equipment (August 2025). **February 2026**: US revoked visas for three Chilean officials for advancing China Mobile's proposed cable from Valparaiso to Hong Kong — first personal sanctions on an allied government over cable routing. See [[Chile-China Cable Sanctions]].
- **Cloud/compute**: US hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP) process Global South data on US-controlled infrastructure.
- **Semiconductors**: See [[Semiconductors]] - the hardware layer that enables everything.

### Governance Models
Two competing approaches to internet governance:
- **Multistakeholder** (US/West): Governments, companies, civil society, and technical community share authority. Embodied in ICANN, IETF, IGF.
- **Multilateral** (China/Russia): States govern through UN institutions (ITU). Pushed at WSIS+20 (December 2025).

### North-South Divide
- 80%+ of AI R&D concentrated in US, China, and Western Europe
- Training data largely harvested from Global South populations
- Infrastructure dependency: see [[Digital Colonialism]]
- African Union Digital Transformation Strategy (2020-2030) seeks collective sovereignty

## Key Actors

### States
- **United States**: Semiconductor export controls, submarine cable security, "defend forward" doctrine
- **China**: Great Firewall, Digital Silk Road, 5G/cable infrastructure exports
- **Russia**: Sovereign Internet Law (2019), 57 internet shutdowns in 2025, "16 KB Curtain" throttling technique
- **European Union**: GDPR, AI Act, Digital Services Act - regulatory power as sovereignty
- **Iran**: Dual-internet system (national intranet + filtered global access)

### Governance Bodies

| Body | Role |
|------|------|
| ICANN | DNS coordination, multistakeholder model |
| IGF | UN forum for internet policy dialogue |
| ITU | UN telecom standards; China/Russia want it to govern internet |
| IETF | Technical standards development |
| WSIS | UN process, +20 review completed December 2025 |

### Corporate
- **Infrastructure**: SubCom (US), HMN Technologies (China), Alcatel (France), NEC (Japan)
- **Platforms**: Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft - private governance of public discourse
- **Censorship tech**: Chinese firms selling filtering/DPI equipment globally

## Key Statistics (2025)

- Internet freedom declined for 15th consecutive year (Freedom House)
- Government internet shutdowns cost $19.7B globally (156% increase from 2024)
- Russia: 57 shutdowns, 37,166 hours of disruption, ~$11.9B economic damage
- UN Permanent Mechanism for Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace operational from March 2026
