# US-Israel-Saudi Arms Sales (January 2026)

## Overview
On January 30, 2026, the Trump administration announced approximately $15.7 billion in combined arms sales to Israel ($6.67B) and Saudi Arabia ($9B). The State Department announced the sales as tensions rise over potential US military strikes on Iran.

## Israel Package ($6.67 billion)

Four separate sales:

| Item | Cost | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| Apache helicopters | $3.8B | 30 helicopters with rocket launchers, advanced targeting gear |
| Light tactical vehicles | $1.98B | 3,250 vehicles for IDF personnel/logistics |
| APC power packs | $740M | For armored personnel carriers in service since 2008 |
| Light utility helicopters | $150M | Small, unreported number |

## Saudi Arabia Package ($9 billion)

- **730 Patriot missiles** + related equipment
- State Department rationale: "will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a Major non-NATO Ally that is a force for political stability and economic progress in the Gulf Region"

Announced after Saudi Defense Minister **Khalid bin Salman** met with:
- Secretary of State [[Marco Rubio]]
- Defense Secretary [[Pete Hegseth]]

## Strategic Context

### Timing Distinction (Wurmser Analysis)
[[David Wurmser]] (Center for Security Policy, ex-Cheney advisor) distinguishes the two packages:

**Saudi Arabia**: Long-term delivery timeframe
- Strategic purpose: "anchor Saudi Arabia to the western structure"
- Concern about Saudi "drifting off to China"

**Israel**: Short-term/immediate delivery
- Apache helicopters: "Israelis would be getting 30 of those fairly quickly"
- Reflects view of Israel as "major element of American deterrence in the region"
- Allows US to "reduce our power footprint to some extent"

### Iran Tensions
Sales announced amid:
- Rising tensions over potential US strikes on Iran
- [[Iran Protests 2025-2026]] and regime instability
- Khamenei warning (Feb 1) that US attack would spark regional war

### Patriot Sale Significance
The 730 Patriot missiles to Saudi Arabia bolsters Gulf air defense capacity. This is relevant to regional strike planning:
- Patriot systems can intercept Iranian ballistic missiles
- Saudi air defense participation would be critical in any US-Iran conflict
- Sale suggests continued US-Saudi defense cooperation despite reported friction

### Gaza Ceasefire Context
Sales also come as Trump administration pursues Gaza ceasefire plan to end Israel-Hamas conflict.
