# Iran Protests 2025-2026

## Overview
Largest uprising since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, beginning December 28, 2025. Started with shopkeeper strikes in Tehran over economic collapse, spreading to 185 cities across all 31 provinces. At least 1,850 killed and 16,784 arrested. Critically, the merchant class (bazaaris) - historically regime supporters - triggered the uprising.

## Timeline
- **December 2024**: Assad falls in Syria, Iran loses key ally
- **2025**: Israel's 12-day attack on Iran kills senior IRGC commanders, destroys military infrastructure
- **2025**: US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities
- **December 28, 2025**: Protests erupt in Tehran with shopkeeper strikes
- **January 8, 2026**: Nationwide internet blackout imposed
- **January 2026**: Protests continue despite brutal crackdown

## Scale
- **185 cities** across all 31 provinces
- **Death toll (disputed)**:
  - **6,842 killed** (HRANA, Feb 1) - 6,425+ protesters, remainder government forces, children, bystanders
  - Previous: 6,126 (HRANA, Jan 27)
  - 3,117 killed (Iran government figure, Jan 27) - claims 2,427 civilians/security, rest "terrorists"
  - 12,000-20,000 killed (activist groups, CBS News, Jan 13)
  - 16,500-18,000 killed (network of Iranian doctors, The Sunday Times, Jan 17)
- **18,122+ documented cases** (HRANA, Feb 1)
- **Deadliest protests in modern Iranian history** (confirmed if higher estimates accurate)
- Described as largest since 1979 revolution
- Now in third week (as of mid-January 2026)

## Latest (Jan 14-18, 2026)

### Death Toll Rising
- Amnesty International: "mass unlawful killings on unprecedented scale"
- Eyewitnesses: brutality "unprecedented and incomparable" to previous waves
- $20 million infrastructure damage in Tehran alone

### Regime Response Hardening
- Justice Minister Rahimi: protesters after Jan 8 guilty of "internal war"
- Protesters categorically labeled "terrorists"
- Regime views protests as proto-revolution to crush completely
- Ayatollah Khamenei called Trump a "tyrant," called for his overthrow

### Execution Postponed
- **Erfan Soltani (26)** - would have been first protester executed
- Postponed after Trump threatened "strong action"
- FM Araghchi on Fox News: "no plan for hanging at all"
- Iran using Fox News to communicate directly with Trump

### US Strike Aborted (Mid-January)

Trump appeared poised to order military strikes on Iran but pulled back:

**Three options presented:**
1. Limited strikes on those killing protesters (signal support)
2. Wider campaign against IRGC/Basij to destabilize regime
3. Strike ballistic missile program (Israel's preference long-term)

**Why Trump backed off:**
- [[Israel]] and Arab allies pressured US not to strike
- US military assessment: Iran would launch larger counter-strike
- No "easy win" - couldn't replicate Venezuela's quick resolution
- USS Gerald Ford still in Western Atlantic from Venezuela operation
- Drones also repositioned away from Middle East
- USS Abraham Lincoln arrived in Gulf (Jan 27)

**Internal debate (reported, characterizations may oversimplify):**
- Tucker Carlson at White House twice (reported - restrainer influence)
- Vance-aligned view: focus on China, not Middle East
- Rubio-aligned view: muscular intervention to support protesters
- Trump encompasses both views at different moments

**Alternative options discussed (reported):**
- Dropping Starlink into Iran
- Persian-language broadcasting
- Both reportedly dismissed or dismantled

Trump's Truth Social post claiming "800 hangings cancelled" appears to be based on inaccurate information.

**Moral Critique (Kori Schake, AEI):**
- "Morally wrong to encourage protesters to run physical risks when you are not actually going to protect them"
- Trump established red line then walked away
- People getting killed as a result
- Lack of US assistance means regime will succeed at ruthless repression

### US-Iran Talks: Istanbul to Muscat (February 3-7, 2026)

**Dramatic sequence** leading to first face-to-face US-Iran meeting:

**Feb 2-3**: US and Iran agree to hold talks Friday (Feb 7) in Istanbul, with regional countries (Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, Oman, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan) as observers.

**Feb 4 (morning)**: Iran requests moving talks to Oman in bilateral-only format, wanting agenda limited to nuclear issues. US reportedly said: "We told them it is this or nothing, and they said, 'Ok, then nothing.'"

**Feb 4 (midday)**: Talks appear cancelled. US envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly prepares to leave. Israeli media reports round as "blown up."

**Feb 4 (evening)**: Arab states (Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Egypt) urgently lobby White House, warning abandoning diplomacy risks regional war and Iran could retaliate against their territories.

**Feb 4 (late)**: Compromise reached. FM Abbas Araghchi confirms talks rescheduled in **Muscat, Oman**. Compromise: US agreed to shift venue and exclude third-party observers; Iran dropped insistence on nuclear-only agenda.

**Attendees**: US envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner; Iranian FM Abbas Araghchi.

**Mediator framework** (proposed by Qatar, Turkey, Egypt) covers three areas:
1. **Nuclear**: US demands zero enrichment and surrender of ~400-440 kg HEU stockpile; Iran has considered transferring HEU to third country
2. **Ballistic missiles**: US wants range/number limits; Iran categorically refuses; mediators propose "no first use" pledge
3. **Regional proxies**: US demands end to support for Hezbollah, Houthis, Hamas; mediators propose weapons transfer ban; analysts assess most room for bargaining here

**Military backdrop**: USS Abraham Lincoln CSG deployed Jan 26; multiple destroyers in Strait of Hormuz; on Feb 3, six IRGC Navy gunboats attempted to stop a US tanker (continued under USS McFaul escort); a US F-35 shot down an Iranian Shahed 139 drone approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln.

**Chatham House** assesses US objective is "strategic submission" of Iran—permanent constraints on nuclear ambitions, narrowed regional role, readiness to escalate abruptly if red lines crossed.

**Assessment**: The near-collapse and rescue of talks demonstrates the centrality of Arab state mediation. The venue shift from multilateral Istanbul to bilateral Muscat reflects Iran's leverage: it won format concessions while the US won agenda breadth.

### Khamenei Warning and Strike Speculation (February 1, 2026)

**Confirmed:**
- Ayatollah Khamenei warned a US attack on Iran would "spark a regional conflict" (Iranian state media, Feb 1)
- US naval posture in region: 6 destroyers, 1 aircraft carrier, 3 combat ships
- US Navy destroyer departed Israeli port for Red Sea (observed Feb 1)
- **[[US-Israel-Saudi Arms Sales (January 2026)|$15.7B arms sales approved]]** (Jan 30): Israel ($6.67B - Apaches, tactical vehicles), Saudi Arabia ($9B - 730 Patriot missiles)

**Weichert Analysis (NTD, Feb 1):**
[[Brandon Weichert]] (author, "The Shadow War") argues US strike remains imminent but constrained:
- Assesses US and Israel "primed to attack" but repeatedly pausing
- Claims delays due to insufficient air defense assets, carrier vulnerability
- Warns Iran ≠ Venezuela: larger geography, stronger air defenses, ideological leadership
- Invokes "Pottery Barn rule" - warns post-conflict Iran could become "the new Lebanon"
- Dismisses US-Iran talks as "another ruse" like before 12-day war

**Wurmser Analysis (NTD, Feb 1):**
[[David Wurmser]] (Center for Security Policy, ex-Cheney advisor) on war trajectory:
- "I don't think it's going to avert a war... president is pretty far out on a limb"
- "Set out terms that Iran upfront cannot accept"
- Key framing: "Iranians negotiating for a negotiation, Trump negotiating an ultimatum"
- Nuclear gap: Trump wants "no program," Araghchi offers "no weapons" - "no common ground there"
- Key question: not *whether* strike, but whether it "goes all the way to bring down the regime"
- "Rump Islamic Republic" scenario: regime elements may offer mid-conflict deal for survival
- But: Trump can't stomach letting regime survive; Israel "even more difficult"
- His sense: "Iranian people and the Israelis will go all the way"

**Parsi Analysis (Al Jazeera, Feb 2):**
[[Trita Parsi]] (Quincy Institute, restrainer perspective) on de-escalation:
- Regional mediation underway: Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, Oman, Saudi Arabia all working to prevent war
- Most effective path: direct Iran-Trump contact - "ball is in Tehran's court"
- Khamenei's warning "not a false threat" - primary audience is Trump
- His read of Iranian calculus: Trump has "exaggerated view of Iran's current weakness" (informed by Israelis)
- Iranian "small war" theory: unprecedented response to "dispel Trump of any belief... this could be a quick glorious victory similar to Venezuela"
- Key framing: "He may win the war, but he will lose his presidency" - midterm calculation
- "So little faith in negotiations with Trump... that argument seems to be prevailing" in Tehran
- Also noted: Ali Larijani (NSC Secretary General) says "framework for negotiations is progressing"

**Analytical spectrum:**
- **Hawks** (Weichert, Wurmser): Strike likely/imminent, focus on post-conflict risks, regime fragility
- **Restrainer** (Parsi): Diplomacy possible, warns of Iranian capability to inflict costs, midterm politics as leverage
- **Realists** (Wright, Nasr): Regime survival likely, no day-after plan, military success ≠ strategic success

**Caveats**: Weichert's operational claims unverified. Wurmser's uprising predictions speculative. Parsi's Quincy Institute is institutionally skeptical of military action. All analysts' characterizations of Iranian/US thinking are analysis, not confirmed.

### Current Status (Late January 2026)
- **Protests sharply reduced**: 7 protests across 6 provinces (Jan 13) vs 156 across 27 provinces (Jan 8)
- Death toll: **6,842** (HRANA, Feb 1)
- Makeshift morgue footage (Jan 10): At least 205 body bags identified by Amnesty International
- Attorney General Movahedi Azad: Protesters to be charged as "enemy of God" (death penalty)
- International solidarity rallies: Berlin, Paris, London, Istanbul
- US strike threat de-escalated; Trump says crackdown "has eased"
- USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group arrived in Gulf region

**Assessment**: Brutal crackdown appears to have succeeded in suppressing mass protests, though information flow severely limited by internet blackout. Regime treating this as proto-revolution to crush completely.

### Expert Panel Analysis (PBS "Compass Points", Late January 2026)

Four analysts debated implications and US options:

**On Whether This Is the Collapse Moment**

[[Vali Nasr]] (Johns Hopkins SAIS) argues the regime is "very vulnerable" and "on its death march for some time" - but this was not the collapse moment. Key observations:
- Iranians looking to outside intervention signals they don't believe they can bring down regime themselves
- No evidence of IRGC fracturing - no defections, no garrisons going to the people
- Islamic Republic designed to survive, not be popular - has "many nodes of power"
- "We're not talking about negotiations... more like Emperor Hirohito meeting General MacArthur"

[[Robin Wright]] (New Yorker) argues regime is "no longer sustainable" but sees the protest movement's weakness:
- "Lots of young Nelson Mandelas in Iran, but there's no African National Congress"
- No organization, infrastructure, or leadership
- Security forces not monolithic - all young men must serve, creating diversity of opinion

**On "Mizaneh?" - Will He Strike?**

[[Behnam Ben Taleblu]] (FDD) reports one word repeated in communications from Iran: "Mizaneh?" - Persian for "Will he strike?"
- All eyes trained on Trump after his red lines
- "It takes a lot to get Iranians, who are a highly nationalistic population, to be willing to call for this level of foreign intervention"
- Reports tweets from within Iran: "If I die from American missile, Ali Khamenei is my murderer"

**On Regime Weakness - External vs Internal**

[[Firas Maksad]] (Eurasia Group) emphasizes external factors:
- Regime at "weakest point since 1979" due to proxy network collapse
- Hamas, Hezbollah degraded; Assad gone
- 12-day war exposed regime as "paper tiger"
- Iran described as "house with no roof" - air defenses destroyed
- But: GCC allies cautioned Trump against immediate strikes due to blowback concerns

**On US Policy Intent**

Maksad argues Trump administration was **never** pursuing regime change:
- Witkoff was texting Iranian FM about deal terms during protests
- Using street pressure to push regime toward negotiations
- "Hard-nosed realist administration not looking to empower protesters"

Witkoff's 4 demands outlined:
1. Removal of highly enriched uranium
2. Ballistic missiles
3. Enrichment limitations
4. Non-state actor proxies

Wright calls these demands "maximalist" - Iran has NPT right to nuclear energy.

**On Military Options**

Taleblu most favorable to intervention:
- "With 47 years of the Islamic Republic, there is no way out but through"
- Distinguishes "foreign-supported regime change" from "foreign-imposed"
- Military action must be "nested in larger strategy" supporting future protests

Nasr warns against assuming military success = strategic success:
- "You can always start a war... but it may not pan out"
- Israeli 12-day war was militarily successful but "didn't get what it went for"
- Danger: Iran may calculate it needs to "draw blood" - not symbolic responses

Wright emphasizes lack of day-after planning:
- "US is perfectly capable of destruction" - cites Iraq, Afghanistan
- "The problem is, what is the construct afterwards?"
- Revolutionary Guards could try to seize power in chaos

**Martyrdom Dynamic**

Wright notes a "new generation of martyrs being created":
- Within Shiite Islam: "better to die fighting for justice than to live with injustice"
- Bodies carried to "Paradise of Zahra" cemetery with crowds shouting "Death to Khamenei"
- Security forces at cemetery trying to break up mourners

### Iranian Government Position (CNN Interview, February 2026)

FM Abbas Araghchi interviewed by CNN's Frederik Pleitgen. **Caveat**: CNN operates in Iran only with government permission.

**On Negotiations:**
- Open to "fair and equitable" deal ensuring no nuclear weapons
- Wants enrichment rights recognized: "if enrichment our right... is respected and recognized... every detail is negotiable"
- Demands sanctions lifting in return
- Current talks through regional intermediaries - calls them "fruitful"
- On trust deficit: "We negotiated in June [2025]... and we were negotiating when they decided to attack us"
- Rejects discussing proxies/missiles: "Let's do not talk about impossible things"

**On Regional Issues:**
- Rejects US involvement: "The source of all these conflicts... is foreign forces who have entered into this region"
- "This is our business... with the countries of the region"
- Claims IRGC "protecting" Strait of Hormuz and "guaranteed safe passage"

**On War Preparedness:**
- "We are prepared even more than before the 12-day war"
- "Our missiles were tested in a real war last time... we learned many lessons"
- War scope warning: "Since US bases are spread all over the region, inevitably many parts of the region would be involved"
- "Certain parties who want to drag President Trump into this war for their own benefits" (implying Israel)

**On Protests (regime narrative - contradicts documented evidence):**
- Claims Jan 8-10 was fundamentally different: "terrorist elements, militias who entered... with guns"
- Claims it was "continuation of those 12 days of war... an operation led by Mossad from outside"
- Claims deaths were increased by outside elements "to tell [Trump]... there are killings, come on" - to drag him into war
- Claims ~2,500 declared "martyrs" by government
- Repeats: "no plan for executions or hangings"
- Claims government "taking care of" martyrs' families, working on "grievances"

**Assessment**: Araghchi's negotiating position (no weapons, keep enrichment, lift sanctions) is consistent with prior Iranian statements. His protest narrative is regime propaganda that contradicts HRANA death toll data (6,126), Amnesty International documentation, and eyewitness accounts of security forces shooting unarmed protesters.

## Key Dynamics

### Why Now?
1. **Economic Collapse**: 42% inflation (December 2025), currency lost 40%+ value
2. **IRGC Decapitation**: Senior commanders killed in Israel's 2025 attacks
3. **Regional Losses**: Assad fell, Axis of Resistance degraded
4. **Accumulated Grievances**: Building since 2022 "Woman Life Freedom" protests
5. **Regime Exposed**: 12-day war and B-2 bombing showed regime is "not 100 feet tall"—not omnipotent or inevitable

### Systemic Economic Crisis (Confirmed)

**Banking Crisis:**
- **Ayandeh Bank collapse** (late 2025) - confirmed trigger for protests
  - ~$5 billion in losses from bad loans
  - Central bank official: "a Ponzi scheme" (self-lending scheme)
  - Run by regime-affiliated individuals
  - **Five other Iranian banks** in similarly fragile condition (reported)

**Economic Indicators (2025-2026):**
- Rial lost **84% of value** against dollar in 2025
- Food prices rose **72% annually**
- Purchasing power fallen **90%+ over 8 years**
- Capital flight: $10-20 billion left Iran in 2025 (Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, Virginia Tech)

**Government Response:**
- New Central Bank governor appointed (Abdolnasser Hemmati)
- Monthly food coupon system introduced January 2026
- Unable to print way out of crisis

**Assessment:**
Victoria Coates (Heritage) argues problems are "not solvable"—regime may collapse under own weight without US military intervention. This assessment is supported by independent economic analysis: Iran experiencing "deepest and longest economic crisis in modern history" (Al Jazeera).

> "The Islamic Republic is dying. While it may suppress this round of protests, it will not emerge from 2026 with its authority, cohesion, or capacity preserved." — GIS Reports

### Merchant Class Revolt
Critical development - the bazaaris historically support the regime:
- Currency collapse destroying businesses
- Food prices up 72%, medical goods up 50%
- Import costs skyrocketing
- Traditional regime base now turning
- Echoes of 1979: merchants abandoned the Shah too

### Security Force Dynamics
- IRGC weakened by 2025 Israeli strikes
- Lower-level commanders now in charge
- [[Artesh]] (regular army) potentially sitting out
- Historical precedent: Shah's military fragmented under pressure

## Regime Response
- Nationwide internet blackout (January 8, 2026)
- Basij militia deployments
- Mass arrests (16,784+)
- Lethal force (1,850+ killed)
- Khamenei: "rioters must be put in their place"
- New central bank governor appointed to address currency crisis

## International Response

### United States
- Trump encouraged protesters, said "help is on its way"
- Threatened military intervention if violent crackdown continues
- Warned against executing protesters

### Background Events
- December 2024: Assad regime fell in Syria
- 2025: Israel's 12-day attack assassinating senior IRGC leaders
- 2025: US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities

## Strategic Implications

### For the Regime
- Weakest position since 1979
- Multiple simultaneous crises
- Leadership vacuum in IRGC
- Economic tools exhausted
- Lost Syria, proxies degraded

### Regional Impact
- **Turkey**: Watching closely, potential opportunities
- **Saudi Arabia**: Concerned about Sunni-Shia spillover
- **Iraq**: Buffer state, already unstable
- **Israel**: Continuing pressure strategy
- **Gulf States**: Monitoring for refugee/instability spillover

## Historical Parallels

### 1979 Revolution
- Shah appeared strong until suddenly wasn't
- Military fragmented when crisis deepened
- Merchants (bazaaris) were crucial swing factor
- Same dynamics potentially emerging now

### 2022 "Woman, Life, Freedom"
- Largest protests in decades at the time
- Regime survived but depleted
- Set stage for current crisis

## Key Uncertainties

1. **Will Artesh intervene?** Secular military may not save theocratic regime
2. **IRGC cohesion?** Can weakened force maintain control?
3. **US intervention?** Trump has threatened military action
4. **Succession crisis?** Khamenei aging, no clear successor path
5. **Economic breaking point?** Currency in freefall

## Competing Scenarios

### Regime Survives
- IRGC maintains cohesion despite losses
- Brutal crackdown succeeds
- External pressure eases
- Economy stabilizes somehow

### Regime Change
- IRGC fragments or sits out
- Artesh refuses to fire on civilians
- Merchants/middle class sustain pressure
- Possible military-led transition

### Prolonged Instability
- Neither side wins decisively
- Economic collapse continues
- Regional spillover
- Failed state trajectory
