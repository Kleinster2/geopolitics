# Panama Canal Crisis (2025-2026)

## Overview
US campaign to reassert control over the Panama Canal, part of the broader "Donroe Doctrine" pattern alongside [[Greenland Crisis|Greenland]] and [[Venezuela]]. Achieved most objectives without military action: CK Hutchison removed from canal ports, US military access restored, Panama exited China's BRI.

## US Actions

### Military
- Security MOU (April 2025): access to three former Canal Zone facilities:
  1. Panama Pacifico International Airport (formerly Howard AFB)
  2. Vasco Nunez de Balboa Naval Base (formerly Rodman Naval Station)
  3. Cristobal Colon Naval Air Base
- Three-year initial term, renewable; explicitly rules out permanent bases
- Joint jungle exercises: 50 US Marines + 61 Panamanian personnel (Jan 12 - Feb 26, 2026)
- Army redesignated unit for jungle warfare training in Panama (Jan 29, 2026)
- PANAMAX defense exercise revival planned for 2026
- White House asked Pentagon to develop military options for the Canal (reported, NBC News)

### Diplomatic
- Rubio's first overseas trip to Panama (February 2025)
- Pressure on Panama to exit China's BRI (achieved)
- Pressure on CK Hutchison port concessions (resolved via court ruling)
- Disputed claims about free warship transit (Panama denies fee waivers)

### Economic
- BlackRock $22.8B deal for CK Hutchison ports (stalled by China, mooted by court ruling)
- Supreme Court ruling achieved what BlackRock deal could not: removing Hong Kong-based control without Chinese regulatory approval

## Panama's Response

President José Raúl Mulino pursued dual strategy of accommodation and sovereignty assertion:

**Accommodation:** Signed military MOU, allowed exercises, exited BRI, audited CK Hutchison

**Sovereignty assertion:**
- "The Canal is and will continue to be Panamanian"
- Took issue to UN Security Council (Panama holds rotating seat)
- Denied US claims about fee waivers
- Supreme Court ruling framed as rule of law, not US capitulation
- Appointed Maersk (Danish, not American or Chinese) as temporary administrator

**Rejecting China:** After Beijing's "heavy price" threat, Mulino publicly pushed back (Feb 5)

## Chinese Involvement

### CK Hutchison
- Hong Kong-based conglomerate (Li Ka-shing family), not Chinese state-owned
- Operated Balboa and Cristobal ports since late 1990s via Panama Ports Company
- Concession auto-renewed 2021 for 25 years
- Trump framed as "China running the Canal"—disputed characterization (per CSIS: distinction between HK private company and Chinese state control matters)
- Contracts voided by Supreme Court (Jan 29, 2026); ICC arbitration launched (Feb 3)

### China's BRI
- Panama first Latin American BRI member (2018), first to exit under US pressure (2025)

### China's Response
- Cosco (state-owned shipping) demanded majority stake in BlackRock consortium (mid-2025)
- Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office: "heavy price" warning (Feb 4, 2026)
- Called ruling "absurd," "shameful and pathetic"
- Analysts note Beijing's options limited: ruling was judicial, not executive; China's economic leverage over Panama modest vs. US leverage

## Canal Statistics (FY2025)
- 13,404 vessel transits (up 19.3% from FY2024)
- $5.7 billion revenue
- Handles ~5% of world trade
- ~$270 billion in US goods transit annually
- Transit saves ~35% vs Cape of Good Hope route

## Strategic Context

Part of the "Donroe Doctrine" territorial pattern:

| Target | Action | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Greenland | Annexation threats | De-escalated at Davos, ambition intact |
| Panama Canal | "Take back" threats | De facto US win via court + military access |
| Venezuela | Military intervention | Maduro captured, US occupation |
| Canada | "51st state" suggestions | Diplomatic friction |

The [[2026 National Defense Strategy]] explicitly declares the US will "guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland."

## Assessment
The US achieved most objectives without direct military action:
1. CK Hutchison removed from canal ports (via court ruling)
2. Military access to three former Canal Zone facilities restored
3. Panama exited China's BRI
4. Joint military exercises reestablished

**Unresolved:** CK Hutchison ICC arbitration; whether China retaliates; new port concession tender; whether US military presence creeps toward permanence; regional diplomatic fallout.

Baker Institute (Rice University) warns threats could be counterproductive—boosting rather than diminishing Chinese influence in the region.
