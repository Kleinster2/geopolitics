# Trade War 2025-2026

## Summary
Trump's second-term tariff campaign, initiated on "Liberation Day" (April 2, 2025), imposed unprecedented tariffs globally using [[IEEPA]] emergency powers. Distinguished by volatility, frequent reversals, and use of tariffs as leverage for non-trade objectives (immigration, political outcomes). Produced the highest US effective tariff rate since 1932. Legal authority challenged and struck down by every court to hear the case; [[V.O.S. Selections v. Trump]] now before the Supreme Court with decision expected mid-2026.

## Liberation Day (April 2, 2025)

### What Happened
Trump announced sweeping tariffs in a Rose Garden ceremony, signed Executive Order 14257:
- **Universal 10% tariff** on nearly all imports, effective April 5
- **Country-specific "reciprocal" tariffs** on 57 named countries, effective April 9
- Methodology: divided bilateral trade deficit by trade volume
- Applied tariffs to uninhabited islands

### Tariff Rates Announced (April 2)

| Country/Region | Additional Rate | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|-------|
| China | 34% (on top of existing) | Later escalated |
| European Union | 20% | |
| Vietnam | 46% | |
| Taiwan | 32% | |
| India | 26% | |
| Japan | 24% | |
| South Korea | 25% | |
| Lesotho | 50% | Highest rate |
| Australia, Brazil, UK | 10% | Baseline only |

### 90-Day Pause (April 9)
One week later, Trump reversed course on most country-specific rates:
- Lowered tariffs to 10% baseline for almost all nations
- **Exception: China** -- raised to 125% (from 34% announced on Liberation Day)
- Pause created massive uncertainty for businesses mid-supply-chain

### Product Exemptions
Approximately 1,039 product categories carved out:
- Smartphones, computers, semiconductors (retroactive to April 5)
- Pharmaceuticals, medical supplies
- Lumber, copper, certain energy products
- Electronics exemption primarily benefited Apple, Dell, and tech hardware importers
- Exemptions limited in scope -- IEEPA tariffs on China still applied to many exempted categories

### Critiques

**Roberto Dumas (Insper economist) analysis:**
- Tariff formula was economically nonsensical
- "Puts tariff, removes tariff, puts tariff, removes tariff" -- creates massive uncertainty
- Destroys supply chains
- Contradicts stated goal of reindustrialization

**Why reindustrialization won't work (Dumas):**
- 25% steel tariff makes semi-finished steel more expensive
- One semi-finished steel worker affects 60 workers using steel as input
- Net effect: higher costs throughout manufacturing
- Countries follow economic cycle: agriculture -> manufacturing -> services
- US already in services economy; can't go backward

## Legal Challenge

### IEEPA Authority
Trump cited the [[IEEPA|International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] for all major tariff actions:
- February 2025: Canada, Mexico, China tariffs (fentanyl/immigration emergency)
- April 2025: Global reciprocal tariffs (trade deficit emergency)

### Court Rulings (All Against the Government)

| Court | Date | Ruling |
|-------|------|--------|
| Court of International Trade | May 28, 2025 | IEEPA does not authorize tariffs |
| D.C. District Court | May 29, 2025 | IEEPA does not authorize tariffs |
| Federal Circuit (en banc, 7-4) | August 29, 2025 | Affirmed; invoked major questions doctrine |

### Supreme Court
- Cases consolidated September 9, 2025
- Oral arguments November 5, 2025 -- majority of justices skeptical of government position
- Decision expected by mid-2026

See [[V.O.S. Selections v. Trump]] for full case details.

## Country Responses

### China

#### Escalation Phase (February-May 2025)
- Only country to fully escalate (per Felipe Loureiro, USP)
- Went "to the last consequences" rather than accommodate
- Chinese retaliatory tariffs reached 125% on US goods
- **Rare earths countermeasure:** Restricted exports to US
- Rare earths value small (~$100 million) but critical for automotive, tech
- Demonstrated leverage capacity
- Agricultural exports hit hardest: soybeans, grains, cotton (~80% of targeted products)

#### Geneva Agreement (May 12, 2025)
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced 90-day bilateral tariff reduction in Geneva:
- Both sides reduced reciprocal tariffs by 115 percentage points
- US tariffs on Chinese goods lowered to approximately 30% (20% fentanyl tariff + 10% reciprocal)
- China reduced tariffs on US goods to 10%
- China eased some non-tariff barriers including rare earth export restrictions
- Effective May 14, 2025

#### November 2025 Extension
- Bilateral tariff reduction extended for one year through November 10, 2026
- US reduced fentanyl-related tariff from 20% to 10%
- China removed some retaliatory tariffs
- Baseline 10% reciprocal tariff maintained
- Section 301 tariff exclusions extended to November 2026

### Canada and Mexico

#### IEEPA Tariffs (February 2025)
- 25% tariff on all non-USMCA-compliant imports (10% on energy/potash)
- Justified by fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration
- USMCA-compliant goods exempted (0% rate maintained)
- By October 2025, approximately 89% of Canada-Mexico imports claimed USMCA exemption

#### Canadian Retaliation
- 25% surtax on American distilled spirits and selected goods
- Provincial liquor stores pulled US bourbon and wines from shelves
- US whiskey exports to Canada fell approximately 80% (spring-summer 2025)

#### USMCA Review (July 2026)
The scheduled six-year review of the USMCA will occur against the backdrop of tariff tensions. See [[USMCA Review]] for comprehensive analysis. Key dynamics:
- If all parties agree to renewal, agreement extends 16 years to 2042
- If any party declines, annual reviews begin with automatic expiration July 1, 2036
- Trump administration expected to seek additional concessions on non-trade issues (migration, fentanyl, defense)
- USTR Greer: "A rubberstamp of the Agreement is not in the national interest"
- What was expected to be routine assessment now a high-stakes negotiation
- 25% IEEPA tariffs on non-USMCA-compliant goods; ~89-95% of Canada/Mexico exports now claiming USMCA compliance to avoid them
- Per Wilson Center: "Trade war or USMCA upgrade -- one or the other, but not both"

### European Union

#### Turnberry Agreement (July 27, 2025)
Per [[Carlos Primo Braga]]:
- Negotiated after Liberation Day
- **Not consistent with WTO rules**
- Terms: US imposes 15% on EU imports; EU imposes 0% on US imports
- Still being analyzed by European Parliament
- **January 2026**: EU announced freezing agreement given Greenland tariff threats

#### EU Retaliation Timeline
- **March 2025**: Announced retaliatory tariffs on 26 billion euros of US exports (steel/aluminum response); delayed to mid-April
- **April 2025**: EU approved 25% tariffs on US goods; delayed again
- **July 2025**: Published list of $84 billion (72 billion euros) in US goods targeted -- including Boeing aircraft, soybeans, whiskey, machinery, chemicals, agricultural products
- **August 4, 2025**: Retaliatory tariffs delayed six months (until approximately March 2026) following framework deal

#### Retaliation List Selection Criteria
1. Easy to source from non-US origins
2. Hurts Trump's political base

**Silver lining (Braga)**: Tensions help EU-Mercosur ratification; Embraer benefits from Boeing limits

### Framework Deals (by July 2025)
The administration concluded framework agreements with eight trading partners during the 90-day pause:

| Partner | Key Terms |
|---------|-----------|
| United Kingdom | Resolved some trade irritants; enhanced market access for US beef and ethanol; pharmaceutical pricing deal (December 2025) |
| Japan | Trade agreement reached July 2025 |
| South Korea | Framework agreement |
| European Union | Turnberry Agreement (15% US / 0% EU) |
| Vietnam | Tariffs set at 20%; Vietnam agreed to reduce barriers to zero |
| Philippines | Framework agreement |
| Indonesia | Framework agreement |
| Switzerland | Framework agreement |

Per CFR assessment: the deals resolved some irritants but kept the 10% across-the-board tariff in place. Far fewer deals than the "90 deals in 90 days" promised by White House advisor Peter Navarro.

### Brazil

**Trade impact (Dumas):**
- Overall balance: $68 billion (down 8%)
- US exports: down 6%
- China exports: up 6%
- Pattern: trade diverted from US to China

**Private sector response (Mauricio Moura):**
- Brazilian business lobbied White House directly
- Sectors: aviation, coffee, meat
- New paradigm: private sector circumvents diplomatic channels

**Ongoing exposure:**
- 10% base tariff remains on many exports
- 40-50% aggregate tariffs on manufactures
- New threat: 25% on countries trading with Iran

## Current Tariff Levels (January-February 2026)

### Effective Rates

| Metric | Rate | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| Overall effective tariff rate | 16.9% (pre-Greenland tariff threats) | Yale Budget Lab, January 19, 2026 |
| Post-consumption-shift effective rate | 14.3% | Yale Budget Lab |
| Historical comparison | Highest since 1932 | Multiple sources |
| Average effective rate (November 2025) | 10.5% (up from 2.3% in January 2025) | Penn Wharton |

### By Country (Effective Rates)

| Country | Effective Rate | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| China | ~35% | Multiple tariff layers; 10% reciprocal baseline maintained under November deal |
| Canada | Mostly 0% (USMCA) | 25% on non-compliant goods; ~89% of trade USMCA-exempt |
| Mexico | Mostly 0% (USMCA) | 25% on non-compliant goods; ~89% of trade USMCA-exempt |
| EU | ~8-9% | Turnberry Agreement at 15%; some countries at baseline 10% |
| Most others | 10% | Universal baseline |

### By Product Category

| Category | Effective Rate |
|----------|---------------|
| Steel and aluminum | 41.1% |
| Automotive vehicles | 15.5% |
| Electronics (exempt categories) | Lower due to exemptions |

## Economic Impact

### US GDP
- 2024 growth: 2.8%
- 2025 projected growth: 1.6% (per Tax Foundation, OECD)
- 2026 projected growth: 1.5%
- Tariff drag: -0.23 percentage points (2025), -0.62 percentage points (2026) vs. baseline (per Tax Foundation)

### Inflation
- PCE prices estimated to increase 1-1.5% in 2025 due to tariffs (per J.P. Morgan)
- Average tax increase per US household: approximately $1,000 in 2025, $1,300 in 2026 (per Yale Budget Lab)
- One of three factors driving Trump's 10-12 point approval decline (per Moura)

### Won't Solve Trade Deficit (Dumas)

Twin deficits identity: if fiscal deficit increases, trade deficit will increase regardless of tariffs.

**Big Bill impact:**
- $3.5 trillion over 10 years
- Debt already 120%+ of GDP (over $38 trillion)
- Increased fiscal deficit -> increased trade deficit
- "This is a macroeconomic identity"

**Historical parallel:** Reagan's 1985 Plaza Accord aimed to devalue dollar to improve trade balance. Didn't work then either -- fiscal policy offset currency moves.

### Cost of Living Impact

Tariffs passed through to consumers:
- One of three factors driving Trump's 10-12 point approval decline (per Moura)
- Democratic 2025 election victories ran on cost of living messaging
- Trump attempting credit card interest rate cap as response

### Tariff Revenue
- FY2025 customs duties: approximately $195-217 billion (up from ~$80 billion in FY2024)
- FY2026 projections: $191 billion (Tax Foundation) to $323 billion (Penn Wharton)

### Global Trade Volumes (WTO Data)
- 2025 trade volume growth: 2.4% (revised upward, driven by frontloading)
- Q3 2025: World trade volume flat (momentum stalled)
- 2026 forecast: 0.5% growth (slashed from 1.8% prior estimate)
- North America exports initially projected to fall 12.6% in 2025
- Asia recorded strongest export growth (9.5% YoY through September 2025)
- WTO characterization: highest tariff levels since the 1930s

### Global GDP Impact
- Global growth: 3.1% (2024) -> 3.0% (2025) -> 2.7% (2026)
- Bloomberg estimate: $2 trillion global GDP hit from trade war
- EU growth: 1.1% (2025) -> 0.4% (2026)

## Tariffs as Political Tool

Tariffs used for non-trade objectives:
- Brazil: pressure on Bolsonaro legal situation (unsuccessful)
- Brazil: big tech regulation (ongoing)
- Various: combined with sanctions, visa restrictions

## US-China Truce (January 2026)

### Current Status
- Trade truce in effect through November 10, 2026
- Potential Trump visit to Beijing in April 2026
- He Lifeng (China's economic czar/trade negotiator) meeting global CEOs at Davos

### Allies Hedging Toward China
Trump's disruptive policies pushing others to strengthen China ties:
- **Canada**: PM Carney visited Beijing (January 2026) - striking deals despite 5,525-mile US border
- **US CEOs**: Tim Cook (Apple), Jensen Huang (Nvidia) making China trips to reaffirm commitment to Chinese market
- Pattern matches Loureiro's analysis: tariff war pushing allies toward China, not away

## Strategic Implications

### Felipe Loureiro Analysis

Trump's tariff war actually **weakened** US position vs. China:
- China demonstrated countermeasures work
- Trade diverted to China (Brazil example)
- Allies pushed toward China, not away
- India placed in "very difficult situation" vs. China

### Reindustrialization Illusion

Dumas: US has "seven magnificents" (tech giants), Silicon Valley -- not losing competitiveness. Manufacturing jobs left due to comparative advantage, not unfair trade. Trying to reverse economic cycle (services -> manufacturing) "doesn't exist in economics."

### CFR Assessment
Per CFR analysis of post-Liberation Day outcomes: the deals resolved some trade irritants but kept a 10% across-the-board tariff in place. The United States has "switched sides, firmly entrenching itself as among the worst of the 'unfair traders.'"

## Key Upcoming Dates
