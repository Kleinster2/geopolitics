# Korean Peninsula

## Overview
Divided peninsula technically still at war (1953 armistice, no peace treaty). Nuclear-armed North Korea poses direct threat to South Korea, Japan, and US homeland. Key test of alliance credibility and deterrence in Asia.

## Current Status

### Division
- **North Korea (DPRK)**: Totalitarian, nuclear-armed
- **South Korea (ROK)**: Democratic, US-allied, prosperous
- **DMZ**: Most militarized border globally
- **Armistice**: No formal peace treaty

### Military Balance
| Factor | North | South |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Active troops | 1.2M | 500K |
| Reserves | 7.6M | 3M |
| Tanks | 4,000+ | 2,600 |
| Artillery | 13,000 | 6,000 |
| Nuclear | 50-60 | None (US extended) |

## North Korean Threat

### Nuclear Arsenal
- 50-60 warheads (estimated)
- Thermonuclear capability claimed
- Miniaturization achieved
- Growing stockpile

### Delivery Systems
- ICBMs (Hwasong-17/18): US mainland range
- MRBMs: Japan range
- SRBMs: South Korea range
- Submarine-launched missiles (developing)
- Hypersonic claims

### Strategy
- Regime survival
- Deterrent against US
- Coercive leverage
- No negotiated abandonment

## Alliance Response

### US-ROK Alliance
- Mutual Defense Treaty (1953)
- 28,500 US troops in Korea
- Combined Forces Command
- Nuclear umbrella
- Extended deterrence

### Extended Deterrence
- Nuclear assurance to South Korea
- Washington Declaration (2023)
- Nuclear Consultative Group
- Visible demonstration (bombers, subs)
- South Korean nuclear debate

### Japan Coordination
- Trilateral cooperation
- Intelligence sharing
- Camp David summit (2023)
- Historical issues managed

## Diplomatic History

### Failed Engagement
| Period | Effort | Outcome |
|--------|--------|---------|
| 1994 | Agreed Framework | Collapsed |
| 2003-2009 | Six-Party Talks | Failed |
| 2018-2019 | Trump-Kim summits | No deal |

### Current Status
- No negotiations
- North testing missiles regularly
- Denuclearization unlikely
- Management vs. resolution

## China's Role

### Position
- Treaty ally of DPRK
- Opposes regime collapse
- Opposes denuclearization pressure
- Buffer state value
- Limited leverage (unwilling)

### Interests
- Peninsula stability
- No US troops on border
- No refugee flows
- Maintain influence

## Scenarios

### Status Quo
- Continued testing
- Sanctions
- Deterrence
- Most likely

### Conflict
- Miscalculation
- Provocation spiral
- North Korea collapse
- US-China involvement

### Negotiated Settlement
- Currently no basis
- What would North accept?
- Verification impossible?
- Peace treaty debates

## Key Variables
1. Kim Jong Un's calculations
2. US commitment credibility
3. South Korean nuclear debate
4. China's influence/willingness
5. Alliance cohesion
6. Domestic politics (all parties)

## South Korean Nuclear Debate
- Growing public support
- Extended deterrence doubts
- Alliance assurance efforts
- NPT constraints
- US discouragement
