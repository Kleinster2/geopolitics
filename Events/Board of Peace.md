# Board of Peace

## Overview
Trump-initiated international body, charter signed January 22, 2026 at Davos (World Economic Forum). Originally proposed to oversee Gaza reconstruction, but the 11-page founding charter does not mention Gaza and establishes a broader conflict-resolution mandate. European officials view it as attempt to create UN rival - a vehicle for Trump to "resolve other conflicts and control international events."

## Key Features

### Structure
- Trump designated as **permanent chairman**, even after leaving office
- $1 billion fee for permanent membership
- Founding Executive Board: [[Marco Rubio]], [[Steve Witkoff]], [[Jared Kushner]], [[Tony Blair]], [[Marc Rowan]], [[Ajay Banga]], [[Robert Gabriel Jr.]]
- Director-General / High Representative for Gaza: [[Nikolay Mladenov]]

### National Committee for the Administration of Gaza
Oversees day-to-day operations in the territory. Members include [[Marc Rowan]] and others from the executive board.

### Gaza Executive Board (GEB)
Sub-board supporting Mladenov's Office of the High Representative for Gaza. Members include executive board overlap (Witkoff, Blair, Rowan, Kushner, Mladenov) plus:
- [[Hakan Fidan]] - Turkey's Foreign Minister
- [[Ali Al-Thawadi]] - Qatari diplomat
- [[Hassan Rashad]] - Egyptian Major General
- [[Reem Al Hashimy]] - UAE State Minister for International Cooperation
- [[Yakir Gabay]] - Israeli-Cypriot businessman
- [[Sigrid Kaag]] - Netherlands' former Deputy PM

### Stated Purpose
- Oversee post-war Gaza redevelopment

### Perceived Purpose (European officials)
- Rival or replacement for [[United Nations]]
- Vehicle to resolve conflicts beyond Gaza
- Mechanism for Trump to control international events

Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Morocco, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, UAE, Uzbekistan, Vietnam

### Declined
| Country | Response |

| Norway | Declined |

### Disputed
| Country | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| Belgium | White House listed as signatory; Deputy PM Prevot stated "Belgium has NOT signed the Charter" |

### Pre-Signing Responses (for context)
| Leader | Country | Response |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Netanyahu | Israel | Makeup of Gaza committee "not coordinated with Israel" (Israel later joined) |
| Mark Carney | Canada | "In principle" but won't pay fee (invitation revoked Jan 23) |
| Giorgia Meloni | Italy | "Ready to do our part" |
| Viktor Orban | Hungary | Called invitation an "honor" |

## Putin's Invitation
[[Vladimir Putin]] was invited to the Board of Peace. Per Morning Joe (January 22, 2026), Putin "committed $1 billion" overnight on condition that his assets be unfrozen. One leader so far has made this commitment.

## European Response

### Dilemma
European official: Putin invitation is "farcical" given Ukraine invasion, but confirms the dilemma - "go along with what Trump wants or risk further splitting apart the transatlantic alliance."

### Davos Tensions (January 22)
Christine Lagarde (ECB President) walked out of Treasury Secretary Howard Lutnick's speech after he said "Europe was dead."

Europeans working to:
- Modify charter terms
- Coordinate response
- Persuade Arab nations to lobby Trump for changes

Approach encapsulates Europe's Trump 2.0 strategy: "play for time, be seen to engage, try to talk him down."

## Significance

### For International Order
- Potential UN bypass/rival
- Trump-centered decision-making vs. multilateral consensus
- Pay-to-play membership model
- Mix of democracies and autocrats (Lukashenko, potentially Putin)

### For Gaza
- Netanyahu objection suggests Israel not consulted on key details
- Qatar and Turkey officials included in Gaza committee (Israeli concern)

## UN Relationship
- Trump initially suggested the board "might replace" the [[United Nations]]
- Later backtracked to saying it has "tremendous potential with the United Nations"
- At Davos signing (January 22): said board "might work alongside the United Nations"
- In November 2025, UN Security Council Resolution 2803 approved a Board of Peace as part of a broader plan including a Gaza security force
- Critics argue the institution bears little resemblance to what was envisioned under Resolution 2803; described as a "pay-to-play club" centered on Trump rather than a Gaza-focused mechanism (The Guardian)
- Charter's sweeping mandate seen as challenging existing diplomatic frameworks

## Timeline
- **September 2025**: Trump first proposes the Board of Peace
- **November 2025**: UN Security Council approves Board of Peace concept as part of Gaza plan (Resolution 2803)
- **January 11, 2026**: Reported Trump would announce appointments within the week
