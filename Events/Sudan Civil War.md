# Sudan Civil War (2023-Present)

## Overview
Catastrophic civil war between Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that erupted in April 2023. World's largest displacement crisis. Massive humanitarian catastrophe with potential for genocide. Regional implications across Horn of Africa and Sahel. Failed transition from military rule turned into devastating conflict.

## Origins

### Post-Bashir Transition
- Omar al-Bashir ousted (2019)
- Civilian-military power sharing
- Fragile arrangement
- International hopes

### Key Actors
- **SAF**: Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan
- **RSF**: Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo "Hemedti"
- Both: Former partners in 2021 coup
- Rivalry over integration

### Trigger
- RSF integration into military
- Power struggle
- Timeline disputes
- April 15, 2023: Fighting erupts

## The Conflict

### Military Situation
- SAF: Air power advantage
- RSF: Ground mobility, manpower
- Stalemate in Khartoum
- RSF territorial gains (Darfur, Kordofan)
- War of attrition

### Geography (Updated Jan 2026)
| Region | Control |
|--------|---------|
| Khartoum | **SAF recaptured** (May 2025) |
| Darfur | RSF (all 5 states, El Fasher fell Oct 2025) |
| Port Sudan | SAF (government relocated here) |
| Eastern Sudan | SAF |
| Kordofan | **Active frontline** — key epicenter as of early 2026 |
| Blue Nile / Nuba Mountains | SPLM-N administration |

### El Fasher Massacre (October 2025)
RSF seized El Fasher on October 26, 2025 — last SAF holdout in Darfur — after a 500+ day siege. Mass atrocities followed. HRW documented widespread looting, executions, and sexual violence. UN aid chief called El Fasher "a crime scene" (per Al Jazeera, November 2025). Humanitarian workers and local officials reported 2,500+ civilians summarily executed; some estimates range higher but lack clear methodology (disputed). HRW published investigation into the El Fasher atrocities on February 5, 2026.

(per HRW, Al Jazeera)

### Atrocities
- Ethnic targeting (Darfur)
- Sexual violence systematic
- Civilian massacres
- Genocide warnings (Genocide Watch: **genocide emergency**, September 2025)
- El Geneina mass killings
- El Fasher massacre (October 2025)

## Humanitarian Catastrophe

### Casualty Estimates

| Estimate | Source | Confidence |
|----------|--------|------------|
| 150,000+ killed | WHO | Reported |
| 61,202 deaths in Khartoum alone (first 14 months) | Lancet study | Reported |
| 400,000 by mid-2025 | Former US envoy Perriello | Estimated |

### Scale (January 2026 - 1,000 Days of War)
- **33.7 million** need humanitarian assistance (2/3 of population)
- **~14 million displaced** (~12M still displaced) — world's largest displacement crisis
- 9.3 million internally displaced
- **21 million** face acute food insecurity
- Famine **confirmed** in Al Fasher and Kadugli (IPC classification), 20+ areas at risk
- WFP warned food aid could run out by **March 2026**
- WFP cut rations **70%** starting January 2026
- 37% of health facilities non-functional
- 14 million children out of school (4 of 5)
- Cholera in all 18 states, dengue in 14, malaria in 16
- IRC rated Sudan **#1 on 2026 Emergency Watchlist**
- Genocide Watch classified as **genocide emergency**
- UN halved 2026 humanitarian appeal; funding only 8-32% of requirements

### Displacement by Destination

| Destination | Refugees |
|-------------|----------|
| Internal | ~9.3 million |
| South Sudan | 1.1 million |
| Chad | 775,000 |
| Egypt | 600,000 |
| Libya | 256,000 |

### Aid Delivery Obstacles
- **201 verified attacks on healthcare** (per WHO), resulting in 1,858 deaths and 490 injuries
- WFP convoy attacked in North Darfur (June 2025, 5 staff killed)
- Drone strike on UN convoy (August 2025)
- Al Fasher under RSF siege — no aid convoy entered the city since start of 2026
- RSF imposes blockade on besieged cities; SAF imposes bureaucratic impediments
- UNFPA forced to withdraw from over half of 93 supported health facilities (funding cuts)

## Regional Dimensions

### External Support (Updated February 2026)

| Actor | Supports | How | Confidence |
|-------|----------|-----|------------|
| UAE | RSF | Chinese-made drones (per US intelligence/WSJ), funding, political cover | Reported (multiple sources) |
| Egypt | SAF | Military aid, political support, hosts peace meetings | Confirmed |
| Russia (Africa Corps) | SAF (shifted from RSF after Prigozhin's death) | Arms, personnel; naval base agreement (Red Sea access) | Reported |
| Iran | SAF | Muhajir-6 drones supplied | Reported |
| Pakistan | SAF | $1.5B arms deal finalized | Reported |
| Saudi Arabia | Mediation | Co-hosts Jeddah talks; part of Quad | Confirmed |
| Colombian mercenaries ("Desert Wolves") | RSF | ~400 former soldiers via Emirati security company (Aug 2025) | Reported (African Arguments) |

**Gold dimension**: RSF-controlled gold from Al Junaid flows to Dubai (Sharjah/Kaloti refinery), then to Switzerland (Valcambi). Wagner smuggled an estimated 32.7 metric tons (~$1.9B) from Sudan between February 2022 and February 2023 (per Chatham House, March 2025). Gold revenue finances the war on both sides.

**ICJ case**: Sudan filed a genocide complicity case against UAE at the ICJ. Dismissed May 2025 on jurisdictional grounds (9-7 vote). UAE denies all allegations.

(per Wilson Center, Atlantic Council, ECFR, Middle East Eye, Chatham House, African Arguments)

### Impact on Neighbors

| Neighbor | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Chad | 775,000+ refugees; RSF cross-border attack killed 7 Chadian soldiers at Birak garrison; weapons transit hub |
| South Sudan | 1.1M refugees; fiscal crisis from Heglig disruption; South Sudanese nationals fighting for RSF (reported, Al Jazeera Jan 2026) |
| Egypt | 600,000 refugees; primary SAF backer; "red line" on Sudan unity; Nile/GERD concerns |
| Libya | 256,000 refugees; arms flows through Libyan territory |
| Ethiopia | Exploited security vacuum — deployed militias into al-Fashaga (July 2025); ~72,000 refugees |

## Peace Efforts

### De Facto Partition

Two parallel governments now exist:
- **SAF government**: Khartoum/Port Sudan under el-Burhan; PM Kamil Idris appointed May 2025; government returned to Khartoum January 12, 2026
- **RSF "Government of Peace and Unity"**: Declared in Nyala (July 26, 2025) under Hemedti; 15-member presidential council; partnered with SPLM-N's Abdel Aziz al-Hilu in the **"Tasees Coalition"**

Formal partition unlikely (per most analysts; Egypt explicitly opposes), but a protracted stalemate with two rival administrations controlling separate territories — de facto partition without international recognition — is the most probable near-term trajectory.

### Heglig Oilfield Seizure (December 8, 2025)
- RSF seized Heglig — Sudan's largest oilfield, handling up to 130,000 bpd of South Sudanese crude
- South Sudan deployed troops under three-way deal
- Threatens South Sudan's fiscal survival (oil revenue dependence)

### Jeddah Talks
- US-Saudi mediation
- Ceasefires failed
- Limited progress
- Process stalled

### "Quad" Framework (US, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE)
- Pushing for ceasefire by March 2026
- Egypt hosted 5th consultative meeting (January 14, 2026)
- Representatives from EU, Arab League, AU, IGAD
- Egypt "red lines": Preserve Sudan's unity, reject secession
- Agreement to pursue immediate humanitarian truce
- **Breakthrough**: First supplies to El Fasher in 18 months
- **US envoy position vacant** under Trump administration
- UNITAMS (UN mission) ended

### January-February 2026 Developments
- **1,000 days of war** reached January 9, 2026
- Government returned to Khartoum (Jan 12) — symbolic milestone
- RSF drone strike on Sinja killed 27 (Jan 13)
- Egypt hosted 5th consultative peace meeting in Cairo (Jan 14)
- Pakistan finalized $1.5B arms deal with Sudan (SAF)
- **SAF broke two-year RSF siege of Dilling** (January 26), reopening supply routes to North Kordofan
- RSF drone strikes hit El Obeid (Jan 30) — targeting SAF airbase, police HQ, telecom, regional parliament
- RSF drone strike in South Kordofan killed 100+ (reported, MadaMasr)
- Kordofan is now primary battleground; fighting threatens Khartoum again from the west
- US diplomats pushing for permanent ceasefire by end of March 2026
- SAF "considering" the US-Saudi truce proposal (per Daily Sabah)
- HRW published El Fasher atrocities investigation (Feb 5)

### Obstacles
