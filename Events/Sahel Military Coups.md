# Sahel Military Coups and West African Military Rule

## Overview
Six West African states are now under military rule as of early 2026 — the highest concentration since the decolonization era. The Guinea-Bissau coup (November 26, 2025) and Benin coup attempt (December 7, 2025) marked the latest escalation in a regional pattern that began with Mali in 2020. The Alliance of Sahel States (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger) has formally exited ECOWAS, Russia's Africa Corps has replaced France's former military presence, and jihadist insurgencies continue to expand.

France's military footprint in West Africa effectively reduced to Djibouti base and small liaison elements.

## Jihadist Insurgency

- **JNIM** (al-Qaeda affiliate): At highest operational capacity since 2018

- Remaining members debate reform

## Humanitarian Impact

- **28.7 million** people needing humanitarian assistance across the Sahel
- **5.6 million** displaced projected by end of 2026
- Humanitarian funding only **8-32%** of requirements
- Economic isolation from ECOWAS withdrawal compounding crises

## Guinea-Conakry Transition (2024-2026)

Doumbouya's September 2024 constitutional referendum extended presidential terms from 5 to 7 years and allowed military officers to run. The presidential election (December 28, 2025) saw Doumbouya win with 86.72% (Yéro Baldé second with 6.59%). Supreme Court validated results January 4, 2026; inauguration January 17, 2026. Opposition and civil society groups challenged the legitimacy of both the referendum and election.
