# US-Venezuela Oil Arrangement

## Overview

Following the capture of Nicolás Maduro (January 3, 2026), the Trump administration assumed control of Venezuelan oil sales. Proceeds are deposited in US-controlled accounts in Qatar, with distribution directed by Treasury and State Department.

## Current Structure (January 2026)

### Qatar Deposits

- **Bank**: Qatar National Bank (QNB), per Bitácora Económica citing unofficial sources
- **Control**: US Treasury oversees accounts
- **Disbursement**: Directed by Trump and Secretary of State Rubio
- **Rationale**: Officials described Qatar as "a neutral location where money can flow freely with US approval and without risk of seizure"

### Initial Deal

- **Value**: $500 million (first transaction, reported January 14, 2026)
- **Seller**: US government marketing Venezuelan crude
- **Destination**: US Gulf Coast refineries (configured for Venezuela's heavy crude)

### Distribution Plan (reported)

- Venezuela's Central Bank (BCV) licensed to access funds
- $330 million allocated to five Venezuelan private banks via foreign exchange tables
- Priorities: healthcare and infrastructure imports
- Treasury Secretary Bessent: funds for "government operations, security and food provisions"

## Prior Arrangements

### Biden License (2022-2025)

Chevron operated under license with proceeds flowing through Venezuelan private banks:

- Chevron sold Venezuelan crude to US
- Deposited Venezuela's share in designated private Venezuelan banks
- Banks sold dollars to businesses for imports/investment
- Bypassed direct government control
- Intended to benefit Venezuelan economy while limiting regime access

### Trump Revision (July 2025)

Changed to in-kind payments:

- Chevron paid royalties as oil rather than cash
- PDVSA received physical crude instead of bank deposits
- PDVSA's share sold by Shineful Energy (linked to sanctioned trader Ramón Carretero)
- Approximately $500 million sold to China via cryptocurrency transactions

### December 2025 Blockade

Trump announced blockade of sanctioned oil tankers (December 17, 2025), creating storage crisis:

**Storage Capacity**:
- PDVSA total capacity: ~35 million barrels (only ~20 million usable)
- ~25 million barrels of residuals already in onshore storage
- ~17.5 million barrels stuck on tankers unable to leave (per TankerTrackers.com)

**Impact**:
- Exports dropped from 950,000 bpd (November) to ~500,000 bpd (December) to effectively zero
- PDVSA began cutting production - nowhere to store output
- Resorted to floating storage on tankers
- Sent residual fuel to oil waste pools to avoid refinery shutdowns

**Context**: The January 2026 Qatar arrangement released this pressure - Wright's "instead of the oil being blockaded, we're gonna let the oil flow" directly addressed the crisis the blockade created.

## Qatar Precedent

Qatar has served as financial intermediary in similar arrangements:

- Biden administration used Qatari banks for Iran sanction relief funds
- Provides neutral jurisdiction outside direct US legal oversight
- Allows fund flows with US approval

## OFAC General Licenses (January-February 2026)

### GL 46 (January 29, 2026)
Authorizes US entities to lift, export, sell, and transport Venezuelan-origin oil:
- Payments must go to specially designated US Treasury account per Executive Order 14373 (Jan 9, 2026)
- Companies must report to State/Energy if selling to non-US buyers
- Venezuela's National Assembly unanimously approved **hydrocarbon law reforms** the same day—suggesting coordinated action

### GL 47 (February 3, 2026)
Authorizes sale of US-origin **diluents** (naphtha, light crude) to Venezuela:
- Critical because Venezuelan heavy crude requires diluents for transport and refining
- Without diluents, PDVSA cannot export efficiently

## Oil Sector Outlook

### Big Oil Reluctance
- **ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods** told Trump Venezuela is "uninvestable"—Trump reportedly angered, threatened to cut Exxon out of future investment
- Exxon cited having assets seized twice; said "pretty significant changes" needed
- **Chevron** also declined new spending, adopting wait-and-see approach
- Both committed only to minimal technical assessment

### Production Outlook
- Current production: ~800,000-900,000 bpd
- Could reach 1.1-1.2 million bpd by end of 2026 if sanctions lifted (Rystad Energy)
- Returning to peak (3 million bpd) would require **$53-58 billion** over 15 years
- PDVSA says pipelines not updated in 50 years

### Oil Privatization
Rodríguez government reportedly opening oil sector to privatization—abandoning a pillar of Chavismo. Represents significant ideological shift.

## Criticism

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA):
> "There is no basis in law for a president to set up an offshore account that he controls so that he can sell assets seized by the American military."

Concerns raised:
- Transparency of offshore account structure
- Placement outside US legal challenge jurisdiction
- Executive authority to control seized assets

## Official Statements

**Energy Secretary Chris Wright** (January 2026):
> "Instead of the oil being blockaded, we're gonna let the oil flow to US refineries and around the world to bring better oil supplies, but have those sales done by the US."

**White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers**: Called it a "historic energy deal...that will benefit the American and Venezuelan people."
