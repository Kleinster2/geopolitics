# USMCA Review (2026)

## Overview
The USMCA's mandatory six-year joint review occurs **July 1, 2026** under Article 34.7. If all three parties confirm extension, the agreement renews for 16 years (to 2042). If any party declines, annual reviews begin for the remaining 10-year term, with automatic expiration on July 1, 2036 if no consensus is reached. USTR Jamieson Greer stated in December 2025 that "a rubberstamp of the Agreement is not in the national interest." North American trade totaled ~$1.8 trillion in 2024.

**Review vs. renegotiation**: The treaty text calls for a "review," not a "renegotiation." Washington intends to treat it as the latter, translating unilateral tariff leverage into structural concessions (per CSIS).

## Mechanism (Article 34.7)

The Free Trade Commission (FTC) -- trade ministers of all three countries -- conducts the joint review:
1. Each party confirms **in writing** whether to extend for 16 years
2. Recommendations for FTC action due **by June 1, 2026**
3. Commission undertakes comprehensive review

**If all confirm**: USMCA renews to 2042; next review in 2032.
**If any declines**: Annual reviews for remaining 10 years; USMCA expires July 1, 2036 if no consensus ever reached.

The sunset clause was a US innovation from Trump's first term, designed to avoid "zombie agreements." No precedent exists for this process.

## US Priorities

### Auto Rules of Origin
USMCA raised Regional Value Content from 62.5% (NAFTA) to **75%**, plus:
- Core components must independently meet RVC thresholds
- **Labor Value Content**: 40-45% must be produced by workers earning $16+/hour
- 70% steel/aluminum must originate in North America

A December 2022 USMCA panel ruled against the US interpretation; the US is expected to revisit. The auto sector will be the most intensively renegotiated area (per Steptoe).

### Labor Enforcement (Rapid Response Mechanism)
The RRM allows facility-level enforcement of workers' rights in Mexico -- the most innovative tool in any US trade agreement.

**Track record** (per Covington & Burling, Economic Liberties):
- 56 petitions filed; 37 cases initiated by US targeting 36 facilities
- At least 12 formal remediation courses agreed
- Nearly two-thirds of concluded cases resulted in worker reinstatement

US wants: faster resolution, broader application beyond manufacturing, stronger forced labor prohibitions.

### Addressing China (Article 32.10)
The "nonmarket economy" clause requires parties to notify others before trade negotiations with China. US seeks to strengthen this and restrict Chinese companies operating in North America, align external tariff approaches, expand rules of origin to prevent Chinese components entering via USMCA partners (per CSIS, Baker Institute).

### Digital Trade
Disputes include Canada's Digital Services Tax (USMCA consultations filed August 2024; Carney announced repeal), Online Streaming Act (per Business Roundtable: "clearly inconsistent" with USMCA), and Mexico's emerging cloud localization requirements.

### Energy
US challenged Mexico's energy policies under dispute settlement in July 2022 -- alleging policies favoring Pemex and CFE have negatively affected over **$30 billion of US investments**. Mexico formally repealed its 2013 energy reforms that had opened the sector to private investment (per USTR, Baker Institute).

### Agriculture and Dairy
- **Canada dairy**: Only **42% of US dairy access** actually utilized due to TRQ allocation practices. 75 Members of Congress called for accountability. US ITC probe into Canadian dairy proteins launched July 2025, findings expected March 2026.
- **Mexico biotech corn**: USMCA panel ruled December 2024 that Mexico's GMO corn ban violated agreement on all seven US claims. Mexico repealed ban February 2025.

### Non-Trade Issues
Administration leveraging review for immigration/border security, fentanyl trafficking, and continental defense spending (per CFR, CSIS).

## Canada's Position

PM [[Mark Carney]] declared: "Our old relationship with the United States, a relationship based on steadily increased integration, is over."

**Priorities**: Preserve market access; protect dispute settlement (Chapter 10 binational panels); achieve certainty for Canadian workers and businesses.

**Concessions already made**: Repeal of Digital Services Tax; flexibility on Online Streaming Act; committed to 2% GDP on defense by March 2026, 5% by 2035.

**Red line**: Dairy supply management -- politically sensitive "third rail" of Canadian politics (per MIR Online).

(per CNBC, Holland & Knight)

## Mexico's Position

**Three strategic goals** (per Economy Ministry): preserve agreement intact; strengthen dispute resolution; ensure reciprocity.

**Key concerns**: Energy sovereignty (defending Pemex/CFE privileges); institutional challenges from judicial reforms; US pressure to restrict Chinese investment; sovereignty on security operations.

Mexico faces the most challenging position -- simultaneous pressure points on energy, labor, Chinese investment, security, and immigration (per Baker Institute, CSIS).

## IEEPA Tariffs Complicating the Review

Trump imposed **25% tariffs** on non-USMCA-compliant imports from Canada and Mexico via IEEPA (February 2025), citing fentanyl and immigration emergencies. USMCA-compliant goods exempted (March 7, 2025); by late 2025, **89-95% of exports** were claiming USMCA compliance.

**Paradox**: IEEPA tariffs undermine trust needed for negotiations while making USMCA compliance more valuable (per Brookings).

**Retaliation**: Canada imposed 25% surtaxes on US spirits and selected goods; US whiskey exports to Canada fell ~80% in spring-summer 2025.

**Legal uncertainty**: Supreme Court decision on IEEPA tariff authority in [[V.O.S. Selections v. Trump]] expected mid-2026 -- could fundamentally shift leverage dynamics.

## Likely Scenarios

| Scenario | Description | Likelihood |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Extension with modifications** | US secures concessions on rules of origin, labor, China provisions | Most likely (per most analysts) |
| **Deliberate non-renewal** | US avoids renewal to preserve leverage through annual reviews and IEEPA tariffs | Plausible (per CSIS, Stratfor/RANE) |
| **Full renegotiation** | Comprehensive reopening of provisions; would require congressional approval | Possible but uncertain |

Per Wilson Center: "Trade war or USMCA upgrade -- one or the other, but not both."

## Trade Data

- North American trade: ~**$1.8 trillion** (2024)
- Mexico surpassed China as largest US trading partner in 2023; maintained position
- US exports to Canada and Mexico up 56% since USMCA entry into force (2020)
- Mexico absorbed 25% of reduction in US-China trade deficit

## NAFTA Comparison

| Feature | NAFTA (1994-2020) | USMCA (2020-present) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Duration | No sunset clause; lasted 26 years | 16-year term with 6-year review |
| Review mechanism | None built in | Mandatory Article 34.7 joint review |
| Labor provisions | Side agreement (NAALC), largely ineffective | Chapter 23 + Rapid Response Mechanism |
| Auto RVC | 62.5% | 75% |
| Digital trade | No chapter | Full Chapter 19 |
| Sunset/termination | Six months' notice withdrawal | 16-year automatic expiration if not renewed |
| China provisions | None | Article 32.10 nonmarket economy clause |

Per CSIS: the USMCA's built-in review mechanism is unprecedented in trade agreements. NAFTA persisted as a "zombie agreement" without periodic accountability.
