## The Wallonia Crisis (October 2016)

### What Happened
Belgium's Wallonia region (population 3.6 million) blocked Belgium from approving CETA, nearly derailing the entire deal:

1. Belgian constitution requires regional parliament approval for federal treaty positions
2. Wallonia's parliament voted against
3. Belgium couldn't approve at EU Council
4. Entire deal stalled for weeks

### Resolution
- Intensive negotiations with Wallonia
- Additional declarations on ISDS, agriculture, public services
- Wallonia eventually approved
- Deal signed October 30, 2016

### Significance
Demonstrated that **one regional parliament** could hold up EU trade deals affecting 500+ million people. This experience influenced Commission's later "split deal" strategy.

## Mixed Agreement Structure

CETA was concluded as a **mixed agreement**:
- Required EU Council approval ✓
- Required European Parliament approval ✓
- Requires all 27 national parliaments to ratify (ongoing)

### Provisional Application
Trade provisions applied since 2017 while awaiting full ratification. Investment court provisions excluded from provisional application.

### Ratification Status (2026)
~15 member states have ratified. Still pending in:
- France (ongoing debate)
- Belgium (Wallonia concerns persist)
- Several others

## Key Provisions

### Market Access
- 98% tariff elimination
- Services liberalization
- Government procurement access
- Professional qualification recognition

### Investment Protection
- Investment Court System (ICS) - reformed ISDS
- Permanent tribunal with appeal mechanism
- Excluded from provisional application
- Awaiting full ratification

### Regulatory Cooperation
- Regulatory Cooperation Forum
- Mutual recognition in some areas
- Preserves right to regulate

## Relevance to EU-Mercosur

The Wallonia crisis directly shaped [[EU-Mercosur FTA]] approach:

| Lesson from CETA | Mercosur Application |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Regional parliaments can block | Commission split deal to bypass |
| Full ratification takes years | Trade portion EU-only procedure |
| ISDS most controversial | Investment separated out |
| Provisional application works | Could apply Mercosur provisionally |

The "split deal" strategy emerged from CETA experience - if one regional parliament can block, structure deals to avoid that veto point.
