# Cuba Secondary Tariffs

## Overview
On January 29, 2026, Trump signed Executive Order 14380 declaring a national emergency under [[IEEPA]] and authorizing secondary tariffs on countries supplying oil to Cuba. The order mirrors the Venezuela secondary tariffs EO (March 2025) and represents the most aggressive US Cuba policy in decades -- targeting Cuba's remaining oil lifelines after [[Venezuela]]'s supply was cut off following Maduro's capture (January 3, 2026). As of early February 2026, no specific tariff rates have been announced; the EO establishes the framework and delegates rate determination to a multi-agency process.

## Timeline

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| **January 14, 2025** | Biden signs SST removal certification (Vatican-brokered deal for 553 political prisoners; 45-day waiting period, never took effect) |

| **January 31, 2025** | Lifts Biden's Helms-Burton Title III suspension |
| **March 24, 2025** | EO 14245: 25% secondary tariff on countries importing Venezuelan oil (effective April 2) |
| **June 2025** | NSPM strengthening Cuba policy; partial travel restrictions |
| **January 3, 2026** | Operation Absolute Resolve captures Maduro -- Venezuelan oil to Cuba cut off |
| **January 11, 2026** | Trump: "no more Venezuelan oil or money" to Cuba |
| **January 29, 2026** | **EO 14380: Cuba secondary tariff authority** (effective January 30) |
| **February 1, 2026** | Trump: US "starting to talk to Cuba" |
| **February 4, 2026** | Pemex CEO Rodriguez confirms $496M of oil supplied to Cuba in 2025; says contract will be upheld |
| **February 9, 2026** | **Sheinbaum confirms oil shipments "currently halted"** — seeks to support Cuba without triggering US reprisals |
| **February 2026** | Pemex cancels scheduled crude cargo; Mexico sends 2 humanitarian aid ships to Cuba instead |

(per White House, Fortune, Washington Times)

## Mechanism

The EO operates through a multi-step process:
1. **Secretary of Commerce** determines which countries "directly or indirectly" supply oil to Cuba
2. **Secretary of State** (consulting Treasury, Commerce, DHS, USTR) recommends tariff rates
3. **The President** makes final determination on scope and rate
4. Tariffs would apply to **all goods** from identified countries -- not just energy products

**Key distinction**: This is not a tariff on Cuba. It penalizes third countries that supply oil to Cuba -- using tariffs rather than traditional financial sanctions as the penalty mechanism.

**Legal authority**: IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1701-1708). The EO declares Cuba's government an "unusual and extraordinary threat" to US national security. Subject to the same Supreme Court challenge in [[V.O.S. Selections v. Trump]].

## Cuba's Oil Suppliers (2025)

| Country | Barrels/day | Share | Status |
|---------|-------------|-------|--------|
| **Mexico** | ~12,284 bpd | 44% | Primary target; Sheinbaum paused some shipments Jan 27 |
| **Venezuela** | ~9,528-27,000 bpd (disputed) | ~34% | Cut off after Maduro capture (Jan 3, 2026) |
| **Russia** | ~6,000 bpd | Small | Minimal, symbolic |
| **Algeria** | Unknown | Small | Historical supplier |

Total oil imports fell from 69,400 bpd (Jan-Oct 2024) to 45,400 bpd (same period 2025) -- a 35% decline.

**Other potentially affected countries**: Spain (continued importing after Venezuela tariff order; faces 25% on automobiles, agriculture, industrial equipment), Canada, and China have been identified as countries trading with Cuba that could face secondary tariffs (per GovFacts).

## Cuba's Economic Crisis

Cuba was already in its worst economic crisis since the 1990s Special Period before these measures:

- **GDP**: Cumulative decline of over 11% (2019-2024); ECLAC projects 1.5% contraction in 2025
- **Energy**: Blackouts of up to 20 hours/day; nationwide blackout affecting 10 of 11 million people (October 2024/2025)
- **Food**: First-ever WFP assistance request (February 2025) -- powdered milk for children under seven
- **Inflation**: Climbing toward 30% annualized at start of 2025
- **Demographic collapse**: Population declined from ~11 million to ~9.75 million officially (or ~8 million per independent estimates); 250,000+ emigrated in 2024; birth rate at historic low (7.2/1,000); 25.7% aged 60+ (most aged in Latin America)

Cuba and Haiti are the only two regional economies set to decline in 2025 (per ECLAC).

## Connection to Venezuela Policy

The Cuba and Venezuela policies are deeply intertwined:
- Cuba-Venezuela oil-for-services deal since early 2000s (subsidized oil for doctors, intelligence advisors, security personnel)
- Venezuela supplied ~50% of Cuba's oil deficit

**Sequential strategy**: March 2025 secondary tariffs on Venezuelan oil buyers --> January 2026 Maduro captured --> January 2026 secondary tariffs on Cuba oil suppliers. Each step tightened the energy noose.

## Intelligence Facilities

### Chinese SIGINT (per CSIS, May 2025)
Four sites identified as highly likely Chinese SIGINT facilities:
- **Bejucal** (near Havana): antenna diameter 425-655 feet, capable of intercepting signals up to 9,300 miles -- covering all of North America
- **Wajay**, **Calabazar** (near Havana), **El Salao** (~100 km from Guantanamo Bay)

### Russian Facilities
- **Lourdes SIGINT station**: Russia's largest overseas signals intelligence facility; technically closed 2001 but satellite imagery (March 2024) indicates renewed activity. Underground facilities built 2010-2019 south of base; antennas repositioned as recently as January 2024 (per The Insider)
- June 2024: Admiral Gorshkov frigate and Kazan submarine docked in Havana

Cuba joined **BRICS as a partner state** on January 1, 2025, further aligning with the Russia-China axis.

The White House fact sheet explicitly cites these facilities as justification for the EO.

## Regional Reactions

**Mexico**: Sheinbaum warned tariffs could "trigger a far-reaching humanitarian crisis." Timeline of Mexico's response:
- **January 23**: Reuters reports Mexico weighing halt to shipments to avoid Trump retaliation
- **January 27**: Mexico halts oil shipments; Sheinbaum calls it "a sovereign decision" (not admitting US pressure)
- **February 4**: Pemex CEO confirms $496M in oil supplied to Cuba in 2025 (~17,000-20,000 bpd of crude and refined products through a commercial contract effective since 2023); says contract will be upheld
- **February 9**: Sheinbaum confirms shipments "currently halted" — attempting to balance Cuba solidarity with avoiding US tariff reprisals
- **February 2026**: Pemex cancels a scheduled crude cargo; Mexico sends 2 humanitarian aid ships as face-saving substitute

Mexico was Cuba's second-largest oil supplier in 2025 (~5,000 bpd after declines, down from 17,000-20,000 bpd earlier). With Venezuela offline since Maduro's capture, Mexico was Cuba's last meaningful oil lifeline. The halt leaves Cuba almost entirely cut off from external oil supply.

**Cuba**: Foreign Minister Rodriguez condemned EO as "brutal act of aggression." Diaz-Canel called threats made under "empty pretext."

**Broader impact**: Regional energy cooperation patterns likely to become more discreet; banking settlement costs expected to rise.

## Humanitarian Dimension

The EO does not appear to include humanitarian exemptions for food or medicine. Trump stated the crisis "doesn't have to be" humanitarian -- framing the oil cutoff as leverage for a deal. CHNV (Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela) humanitarian parole program was separately revoked earlier in 2025.

## Historical Context: US-Cuba Embargo

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1960 | Partial trade embargo after nationalizations |
| 1962 | Kennedy formalizes full embargo |
| 1992 | Cuban Democracy Act (Torricelli Act) tightens embargo |
| 1996 | **Helms-Burton Act** codifies embargo into law (only Congress can fully lift) |
| 1996-2019 | Every president suspended Title III every 6 months |
| 2014 | Obama begins normalization |
| 2019 | Trump activates Helms-Burton Title III for first time |
| 2021 | Trump re-designates Cuba as SST |
| 2025-2026 | Full reversal; secondary tariff mechanism added |

The Helms-Burton Act codified the embargo into federal law, meaning only Congress -- not the president -- can fully lift it.
