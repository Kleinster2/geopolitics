# Iran-Israel Shadow War

## Overview
Decades-long covert conflict between Iran and Israel fought through assassinations, sabotage, cyber attacks, and proxy warfare. Occasionally breaks into direct confrontation. Escalated dramatically in 2024 with unprecedented direct attacks between the two states.

## Nature of Conflict

### Existential Framing
- **Iran**: Israel as "illegitimate Zionist entity" to be destroyed
- **Israel**: Iranian nuclear program as existential threat
- Both view the other as implacable enemy
- No diplomatic relations since 1979

### Shadow War Characteristics
- Plausible deniability (mostly)
- Below war threshold
- Proxy utilization
- Assassinations and sabotage
- Cyber operations
- Occasional direct strikes

## Theaters of Operation

### Syria
- Israel strikes Iranian/Hezbollah targets
- Hundreds of strikes since 2013
- "Campaign Between Wars"
- Prevent weapons transfers
- Degrade Iranian presence

### Lebanon
- Hezbollah as primary front
- Israeli surveillance
- Periodic conflicts (2006)
- Assassination operations

### Iran Itself
- Nuclear scientist assassinations
- Sabotage operations
- Cyber attacks
- Intelligence operations

### High Seas
- Ship attacks (Iranian/Israeli-linked)
- Shadow naval warfare
- Persian Gulf incidents
- Mediterranean operations

### Global
- Attacks on Iranian/Israeli targets worldwide
- Embassy bombings (attributed)
- Assassination attempts
- Intelligence operations

## 2025: Full-Scale War

### Failed Diplomacy (April-June 2025)
- Trump sends letter to Khamenei proposing nuclear talks

- 60-day deadline set
- Deadline passes without agreement

### June 2025: Israel's 12-Day Attack
- Beginning June 13, 2025: Israel launches comprehensive strikes
- **US participation**: Joint US-Israel operations
- **Targets**: Nuclear facilities, military infrastructure
- **Leadership decapitation**: Multiple senior IRGC commanders killed
- **Air defenses**: Destroyed, leaving Iran exposed
- Goal: Prevent nuclear weapons development

### US Strikes on Nuclear Facilities
- US directly strikes Iranian nuclear sites
- **B-2 stealth bombers** used (confirmed)
- First direct US military action against Iran's nuclear program
- Significant damage to enrichment capacity
- Washington Week (Jan 2026): "took out 3 nuclear sites"

### Results
- IRGC leadership decimated
- Nuclear program set back
- Air defense capability destroyed
- Regime severely weakened
- Set stage for [[Iran Protests 2025-2026]]

## 2026: Current Status

### Post-War Equilibrium (Fragile)

The June 2025 war left Iran severely damaged but not defeated, creating a structurally unstable equilibrium.

**Iran's condition:**
- Air defenses destroyed -- described as "house with no roof" (Firas Maksad, Eurasia Group)
- IRGC leadership decimated; senior commanders killed
- Nuclear program set back (IAEA: enrichment capability "curtailed")
- FM Araghchi claims Iran has "reconstructed everything damaged" and "learned many lessons" (CNN, February 2026) -- disputed by Western analysts
- Iran reportedly reconstituting ballistic missile stockpile; Israel assesses Iran could produce hundreds of missiles per month once recovery complete

**Structural instability:** RAND Corporation assessed the post-June 2025 situation as a detente that "won't last" (January 2026). Geopolitical Monitor characterized it as a "high-risk equilibrium" with a "use it before you lose it" dynamic on both sides.

### Iran Preemptive Strike Concerns

**Iran's Defence Council warning (January 6-7, 2026):**
Iran's newly created Defence Council stated Iran would not limit itself to reacting "only after an action has taken place" but would regard "concrete signs of threats as part of the security equation" (per Israel Hayom, Haaretz). This was interpreted as a signal that Iran reserves the right to strike preemptively.

**[[Amos Yadlin]] warning (Channel 12, January 11-12, 2026):**
Former Aman chief warned Iran might launch a preemptive attack despite it appearing irrational by Western standards:
- "Jihadi logic, extremist religious logic, could be different" from Western cost-benefit analysis
- IDF should prepare "as though there is going to be a surprise"
- Cited Iran's desire for revenge following June 2025 war
- Applied October 7 lesson: actors "immune to deterrence" can launch strategically suicidal surprise attacks

**IDF response:** Within days, IDF said it remained on alert for "surprise scenarios" -- mirroring Yadlin's framing (per Times of Israel, January 12).

**Brigadier General (Res.) Amir Avivi** (Israel Defense and Security Forum, January 28, 2026): Warned Israel may need to strike Iran before Washington moves. "We are building up toward a campaign in Iran. There could be a preemptive Iranian strike" (per Israel Hayom).

### Israel's Posture
- Waiting as [[Iran Protests 2025-2026|protests]] unfold; giving Trump space to decide
- Netanyahu: Will not allow Iran to rebuild missiles or nuclear program
- Prepared to strike again if Iran reconstitutes
- Security cabinet weighing whether to act independently or wait for US coordination
- Israel views Iranian ballistic missile reconstitution as a new "red line"

### US-Israel Coordination
- Trump administration sees weakened Iran as opportunity
- Abraham Accords expansion as regional strategy
- Trump has threatened military intervention if crackdown continues
- Gap emerging: US sources question some Israeli assessments of missile threat scale
- US-Iran talks scheduled for Muscat, Oman (February 7, 2026) via Witkoff-Araghchi channel

## Rules of Engagement (Evolving)

### Traditional Red Lines
- No direct state-on-state attacks
- Proportional responses
- Geographic limitations
- Avoid full war

### Eroding Rules
- Direct attacks normalized (2024)
- Leadership targeting accepted
- Geographic expansion
- Escalation spiral risk
