# Ethiopia-Eritrea Crisis

## Overview
Relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea have collapsed from wartime alliance (Tigray War, 2020-2022) to open hostility. ICG included Ethiopia-Eritrea in its "Ten Conflicts to Watch in 2026," warning another war could "tip the Horn of Africa into all-out conflagration." The crisis is driven by Ethiopia's demand for Red Sea port access (Assab), three simultaneous Ethiopian internal insurgencies partly fueled by Eritrea, Egypt's military encirclement via port upgrades, and Gulf power competition.

## Core Driver: The Port Question

PM Abiy Ahmed has called Red Sea access an "existential matter" for landlocked Ethiopia (~132-139 million people depending on source, largest landlocked country in the world). He specifically seeks the port of Assab, which has been Eritrean territory since independence in 1993. Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki categorically rejects any concession.

### Somaliland MOU (January 1, 2024)
Ethiopia signed an MOU with Somaliland for a ~20 km coastline lease for 50 years (naval and commercial use). In exchange, Ethiopia would recognize Somaliland as a sovereign state. Somalia, Egypt, Turkey, and the Arab League rejected the deal. Turkey brokered the **Ankara Declaration** (December 12, 2024) pausing the dispute -- Ethiopia recognized Somalia's territorial integrity while Somalia acknowledged Ethiopia's interest in sea access "through lease and contract under the sovereignty of the Federal Government of Somalia." Technical negotiations were supposed to begin February 2025; status unclear. Israel's recognition of Somaliland (December 26, 2025) complicated the picture further.

### Ethiopia's Naval Ambitions
Ethiopia established permanent naval headquarters and training facilities in Addis Ababa by 2025, graduated its first cohort of officers, and signed a naval cooperation agreement with Russia after an earlier French partnership collapsed. Ethiopia also participated as an observer in the BRICS+ "Will for Peace 2026" naval exercise. These moves underscore that the port question is not rhetorical -- Ethiopia is building the institutional infrastructure for a navy it has no coastline to base.

## Abiy's "Two Waters" Doctrine

PM Abiy Ahmed frames Ethiopia's Nile and Red Sea challenges as a single geopolitical problem he calls "Two Waters." Ethiopia's Institute of Foreign Affairs published a 150-page book in February 2024, "The Two Water Grand Strategy," drafted during the Tigray War. President Taye Atske Selassie stated: "Ethiopia exists between the Nile and the Red Sea and its destiny is tied closely to these two waters."

The GERD dispute with Egypt and the quest for Red Sea port access are, in Abiy's view, facets of one challenge: Egypt has historically used Eritrea and Red Sea access denial as leverage over the Nile, dating back to Egyptian sponsorship of Eritrean separatists in the 1950s to prevent Ethiopian dam-building.

Martin Plaut (University of London, Institute of Commonwealth Studies) confirms this long-arc framing: "The Nile is at the heart of everything, when you go back to the beginning. Egypt has been sponsoring the Eritreans as far back as the 1950s to try and stop the Nile being used."

The Red Sea controls access to Cairo's other economic lifeline, Suez. This means any resolution likely requires a package deal addressing both water rights and sea access simultaneously.

## ICG Assessment

ICG included Ethiopia-Eritrea in its **"Ten Conflicts to Watch in 2026"**:

- Last Ethiopia-Eritrea war (1998-2000): trench warfare, tens of thousands killed
- Confining war to Assab unrealistic — Eritrea would open another front, increase support for anti-Addis groups
- Risk of war spilling into Tigray, with Eritrea activating new TPLF links
- Mitigating factors: neither side can predict outcome; Ethiopia wants continued IMF support

Separately, ICG's January 2026 briefing warned that the TDF moves into Tselemti and Korem/Alamata "heightened war risks further."

RANE/Stratfor: Ethiopia unlikely to launch large-scale invasion in 2026, but proxy clashes likely to intensify and could escalate quickly.

Eritrea's state media (Shabait) published a rebuttal January 16, 2026.

## Egyptian Encirclement

### Assab Port Upgrade (Late October 2025)
Eritrea and Egypt finalized a deal for Egypt to upgrade the Red Sea port of Assab:
- Berths for warships (destroyers, submarines, troop/helicopter carriers)
- Refueling/resupply for Egypt's southern fleet
- Small but elite Egyptian military contingents
- Egyptian FM Abdel Aaty: "non-shoreline countries have no role in Red Sea governance," naming Ethiopia directly

### Doraleh Port (Djibouti, December 2025)
Egypt simultaneously finalized a deal to develop Djibouti's Doraleh port.

Both Assab and Doraleh lie near the Bab el-Mandeb strait. This creates a potential Egyptian military presence on Ethiopia's northern maritime flank, driven primarily by the **GERD/Nile water dispute** — Egypt views the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam as an existential threat.

## Ethiopian Internal Conflicts

### Amhara/Fano Insurgency
- Began April 2023 when government attempted to dissolve Amhara Special Forces
- September 2025: "Operation Adem Ali" toward Woldiya (per Critical Threats)
- **January 22, 2026**: Two largest Fano factions unified into **Amhara Fano National Movement (AFNM)** — first joint command
- Ethiopian FM accuses Eritrea of "funding, mobilizing, and directing" Fano
- Arms reportedly funneled through porous Sudanese border

### Oromia/OLA Conflict
- December 2024 peace deal with breakaway OLA faction reduced some violence
- OLA continues to operate across Oromia
- UN: 3.2 million children out of school due to fighting

### Tigray Flare-up (January 2026)
TPLF split into two factions:
- **Debretsion Gebremichael** faction: now aligned with Eritrea
- **Getachew Reda** faction: aligned with federal government (headed Interim Administration until March 2025)

Key events:
- January 26: TDF moved into Tselemti; clashed with federal troops and Amhara militias
- January 29: TDF entered Korem/Alamata without federal resistance
- January 31: Government drone strikes in central Tigray; all flights to Tigray cancelled
- ICG warns this flare-up is the most dangerous trigger — Eritrea could use Tigray instability as pretext for direct intervention

### February 2026 Escalation

By February 2026, Marc Champion (Bloomberg Opinion) reports federal forces have been sent toward Tigray, with skirmishes and drone strikes continuing. ICG issued a report on February 19 warning that the risk of renewed conflict is high. On February 25, the Tigray regional administration rejected federal decisions to suspend elections in contested areas as "a direct attack on our people, designed to dismantle Tigray."

Ahmed Soliman (Chatham House, Horn of Africa researcher): "All these conflicts are part of the same regional conflict system, with the alliances helping to shape how they're sustained and metastasize."

**State-on-state dimension**: Any renewal of hostilities would likely involve interstate conflict — Eritrea switching sides to fight alongside the TPLF against the federal government. This represents a fundamental realignment from the 2020-2022 war when Eritrea and Ethiopia allied against the TPLF.

### Proposed Grand Bargain (February 2026) (disputed)

The National (Abu Dhabi) reported on February 23, 2026 that Egypt proposed backing Ethiopia's Red Sea access if Addis showed flexibility on GERD water use. Conditions reportedly included binding rules on dam filling and water releases during droughts, and abandoning coastal military base ambitions. The proposal was reportedly delivered to Abiy in mid-February and also sent to Washington for Trump's mediation efforts.

**Egypt denied the report on February 25**: an unnamed official called it "entirely unfounded," stressing that "governance and security of the Red Sea are limited exclusively to the littoral states" (per Daily News Egypt). Horn Review called it "a tactical maneuver amid contradictions and denials."

Champion argues the underlying trade is "eminently solvable" — science suggests GERD (built solely for power generation) need not threaten downstream water supplies given proper coordination. But Egypt's public denial complicates any quiet diplomacy.

### Trump Mediation Potential

Champion argues Trump is uniquely positioned to lead pre-emptive diplomacy: strong relationships with most major players (many sit on his Board of Peace), and none of the parties actually want war. The political rewards for Trump would be slim, but "there may be few more feasible, consequential foreign policy gains he could achieve." The US has sent diplomats and delivered messages of restraint to Abiy, but the three-dimensional deal required — balancing Ethiopian power/sea access, Egyptian water security, Eritrean security, and Tigrayan peace deal implementation — demands higher-level engagement.

(per Champion, Bloomberg Opinion, February 26, 2026)

## Eritrea's Strategy

Despite ~3.5 million population vs Ethiopia's ~120 million, Eritrea compensates through proxy warfare and external alliances (per Soufan Center, Horn Review):

1. **Proxy warfare**: Arms and trains Fano through Sudan; allied with Debretsion TPLF faction ("Tsimdo" alliance)
2. **External destabilization**: Keeping Ethiopia bogged down in internal conflicts prevents power projection toward Assab
3. **Red Sea leverage**: Offered Saudi Arabia preferential Assab port access; signed Egyptian port deal
4. **Sudan alignment**: Backs SAF; reportedly provides training, arms, and EDF combat elements
5. **TPLF-Eritrea "Tsimdo" realignment**: Former mortal enemies — Eritrea and Debretsion's TPLF — now tactically allied against Abiy

## Regional Power Blocs

Two blocs emerging:

### UAE-Ethiopia-Israel Axis
- UAE is Ethiopia's closest Gulf partner
- Israel recognized Somaliland (December 26, 2025)
- Ethiopia provides logistical support for UAE-sponsored RSF (per ICG)

### Saudi-Egypt-Turkey-Eritrea-Somalia ("Coalition of the Status Quo")
- Per Horn Review (January 2026): encirclement strategy against the UAE-Ethiopia-Israel triangle
- Saudi engagement intensifying under Vision 2030
- Turkey brokered Ankara Declaration (Ethiopia-Somalia, December 2024)
- Egypt's military expansion via Assab and Doraleh
- **February 9, 2026**: Somalia signed defense cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia, deepening alignment

## Connection to Sudan Civil War

- Eritrea supports SAF; EDF fighters reportedly deployed in combat
- Ethiopia has maintained nominal neutrality but in event of war could "step up support for RSF" (ICG)
- **ICG Briefing 210 (Feb 2026)**: Ethiopia allegedly operates an RSF training camp in Benishangul-Gumuz region for fighters to enter Sudan's Blue Nile state — deepening antagonism with both Eritrea and the TPLF
- Arms funneled to Fano through porous Sudanese border
- Sudan's chaos directly enables proxy war inside Ethiopia
- An Ethiopia-Eritrea war would likely draw both sides deeper into Sudan on opposite sides

## Red Sea / Bab el-Mandeb Dimension

The Horn of Africa sits at the Bab el-Mandeb strait, through which roughly 10% of global trade passes. An Ethiopia-Eritrea war centered on Assab would directly threaten this chokepoint, layering a state-on-state conflict onto the existing Houthi shipping disruption. As of mid-2025, Houthi attacks had reduced Red Sea container shipments by 75%, with 95% of container ships rerouted around Africa (per Atlas Institute). Foreign powers have multiplied ports and military bases across Djibouti, Eritrea, Sudan, and Somalia, transforming the Horn into a junction between Middle East, Indo-Pacific, and Mediterranean security systems.

(per ACLED, Horn Review)

## Assessment

The **Global Peace Index 2025** identified Ethiopia-Eritrea as one of four global dyads "at highest risk of rapid and severe escalation." CFR's "Conflicts to Watch in 2026" also flagged the dyad.

Some analysts argue Ethiopia and Eritrea are **effectively already at war through proxies** (per Pan African Review). The question is whether it transitions to direct interstate war.

Nine reinforcing dynamics:
1. Ethiopia's existential port demand vs Eritrea's sovereignty
2. Three simultaneous Ethiopian internal insurgencies, partly externally fueled
3. Eritrea's proxy warfare strategy
4. TPLF-Eritrea realignment
5. Egypt's encirclement via Assab and Doraleh
6. Gulf power competition (UAE-Ethiopia vs Saudi-Egypt-Eritrea)
7. Sudan civil war providing arms pipelines and strategic chaos
8. Red Sea militarization layering onto Houthi shipping disruption
9. Distracted international community
