# European Nuclear Debate (2025-2026)

## Overview
Growing debate across Europe about developing independent nuclear deterrence as doubts mount about US extended deterrence under Trump. France and UK already have nuclear weapons; the question is whether to extend protection to allies or whether non-nuclear states should develop their own capabilities.

## Major Development: Northwood Declaration (July 2025)

The debate moved from theoretical to operational with the [[Northwood Declaration]]:

- **July 10, 2025**: UK-France signed first explicit nuclear coordination agreement
- Commits that "there is no extreme threat to Europe that would not prompt a response by our two nations"
- Established Nuclear Steering Group (first met December 2025 in Paris)
- IISS: "Most far-reaching step yet in UK-France nuclear cooperation"

This provides an embryonic European nuclear umbrella framework that others may join.

## Drivers

### Loss of Confidence in US Umbrella
Two shocks triggered the debate:
1. **Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine** - heightened threat perception
2. **Trump administration (2025-)** - doubts about US commitment to NATO

Per Carnegie Endowment: "Recent leaks confirmed antagonism leading members of the administration feel toward Europe, leading Europeans to seriously worry about whether Washington will continue to extend nuclear deterrence to the continent."

### Greenland Crisis
US threatening a NATO ally over [[Greenland Crisis|Greenland]] has accelerated the debate. If the US would threaten Denmark, what guarantees remain for other allies?

## Country Positions

### France
- **Current arsenal**: ~290 warheads
- **Macron (March 2025)**: Offered to open "strategic debate with European allies" on assigning France's nuclear mission to protect others on the continent

### United Kingdom
- **Current arsenal**: ~225 warheads (Trident submarines)
- Potential partner for "Eurodeterrent" with France
- Post-Brexit, defense relationship with Europe unclear

### Germany
- **Friedrich Merz (February 2025)**: Declared US "no longer trustworthy," called for nuclear sharing talks with Paris
- **February 2026**: Merz government in active negotiations with UK/France on joining nuclear umbrella
- Spokesman Stefan Cornelius: "The negotiations that we are conducting are at a very early stage"
- Historical reluctance to nuclear weapons now being reconsidered
- Could contribute funding/hosting rather than development

### Poland
- **PM Donald Tusk**: Said Poland "is talking seriously" with Paris about French nuclear protection
- Floated idea of Poland acquiring its own nuclear weapons
- Told parliament: "Poland must pursue the most advanced capabilities, including nuclear and modern unconventional weapons"

### Finland and Sweden
- New NATO members with heightened threat perception
- **Sweden (January 2026)**: PM Ulf Kristersson confirmed talks with UK and France about "nuclear umbrella" protection
- UK government confirmed Starmer discussed proposal with Kristersson
- Technical challenges: only have light-water reactors (not suitable for weapons-grade plutonium production)
- More likely to seek protection from France/UK than develop own

### Baltic States
- Most vulnerable to Russian aggression
- Strong interest in any European nuclear umbrella
- No indigenous capacity

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Anglo-French "Eurodeterrent"
- Extend UK/French nuclear umbrella to EU/NATO allies
- Model: US extended deterrence, but European-controlled
- Challenges: Command and control, cost sharing, credibility

### Option 2: EU Nuclear Force (MLF Revival)
- Multilateral Force concept from Kennedy era
- Shared ownership/control
- Challenges: NPT constraints, national sovereignty concerns

### Option 3: NATO Nuclear Sharing Expansion
- Expand existing B61 arrangements
- More countries host US weapons
- Challenge: Depends on US commitment (the core problem)

### Option 4: National Programs
- Individual countries develop own weapons
- Most destabilizing option
- NPT withdrawal required for most

## Technical Feasibility

[[Peter Zeihan]] claims countries like Lithuania, Poland, Germany, Finland, Sweden, and Romania "could develop a crude nuclear device in a matter of weeks."

**Expert assessment** (per Euronews/Arms Control Association):
- **Exaggerated** - While some European states have elements required, "chances of another European state going nuclear are slim"
- Challenges: fissile material production, delivery systems, testing, time
- Finland/Sweden lack suitable reactors
- Germany has capability but deep political/constitutional barriers
- Poland would need years, not weeks

**More realistic timeline**: Years to decades for non-nuclear state, depending on starting point

## Obstacles

### Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
- Most European states are signatories
- Would need to withdraw (6-month notice)
- Would damage international nonproliferation regime
- Potential sanctions/isolation

### Domestic Politics
- Strong anti-nuclear movements in Germany
- Public opinion varies by country
- Coalition governments complicate decisions

### Technical Barriers
- Fissile material production
- Weapons design expertise (limited outside UK/France)
- Delivery systems (missiles, aircraft)
- Testing (banned under CTBT)

### Coordination Challenges
- Who controls? Who pays?
- NATO integration vs. EU defense
- UK post-Brexit relationship
- Command authority in crisis

## Macron's Expanded Deterrence (January 15, 2026)

Following emergency defence council meeting at the Elysée Palace, Macron declared:
- "Nous sommes prêts à dissuader pour défendre notre sol" (we are ready to deter to defend our territory)
- Described European territory as part of France's "vital interests"—a significant doctrinal expansion
- IISS: "unprecedented signal" that France may extend nuclear deterrent to European allies

This goes beyond the March 2025 offer of a "strategic debate"—it explicitly frames European defense as a French vital interest warranting nuclear deterrence.

### SIPRI Assessment (February 2026)
After New START's expiration, SIPRI published: "After New START expires, Europe needs to step up on arms control"
- Argues Europeans must take more active role since US-Russia bilateral framework has collapsed
- Notes Russia has approximately **1,477 tactical nuclear weapons** vs US ~200—"precisely the weapon systems that pose the greatest threat to Europe's security"
- These were never covered by New START, and with the treaty gone, broader arms control architecture further weakened

## Current Status (February 2026)

The [[Northwood Declaration]] has moved the debate from theory to practice:

**Concrete developments:**
- UK-France Nuclear Steering Group operational (December 2025)
- Germany in negotiations to join framework
- Sweden in discussions for umbrella protection
- Macron's January 15 speech explicitly extends deterrence to European territory

**Remaining gaps:**
- Per Carnegie Endowment: "Europe still lacks a shared framework and a coherent epistemic community on deterrence"
- Command and control arrangements undefined
- Cost sharing not resolved
- Credibility against Russia's larger arsenal untested

## Zeihan's Assessment

> "We're now at the point where there's active political discussions going on in all those countries and more about how to prepare for what's next and nukes are absolutely part of the conversation."

He argues Europe lacks time for conventional buildup given the revolution in military affairs visible in Ukraine, making nuclear deterrence the faster path.
