# JCPOA (Iran Nuclear Deal)

## Overview
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, negotiated 2013-2015 between Iran and P5+1, constrained Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Hailed as diplomatic achievement, it collapsed after US withdrawal in 2018. Efforts to revive it have failed.

- Stockpile limited to 300 kg LEU
- Centrifuges reduced (from 19,000 to 6,104)
- Only IR-1 centrifuges
- Fordow: No enrichment (research only)

#### Plutonium Path
- Arak reactor modified (no weapons-grade plutonium)

- No reprocessing

#### Verification
- IAEA enhanced access
- Continuous monitoring

#### Duration
- Enrichment limits: 15 years
