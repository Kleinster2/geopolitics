# Trump Latin America Summit (March 2026)

President [[Donald Trump]] is convening a summit of allied Latin American leaders in Miami on March 7, 2026. The explicit objective: rally ideological allies to counter [[China]]'s growing strategic influence in the Western Hemisphere.

## Objective

The summit has one clear geopolitical goal: push back on China's expansion into Latin American ports, natural resources, energy, and telecommunications. Washington's 2025 National Security Strategy frames Chinese activity in the hemisphere as a direct threat and outlines what Trump calls the "Donroe Doctrine" — an update to the [[Monroe Doctrine]] asserting US primacy in the Americas.

Per PIIE (February 18, 2026): the administration is "entrenching Latin America as the main stage for a geopolitical confrontation between the United States and China" (confirmed, public analysis).

## Invited Leaders

Conservative/right-aligned heads of state:
- [[Javier Milei]] ([[Argentina]])
- [[Nayib Bukele]] ([[El Salvador]])
- President of [[Paraguay]]
- President of [[Bolivia]]
- President of [[Ecuador]]
- President of [[Honduras]]

## Not Invited

Left-aligned leaders:
- [[Lula]] ([[Brazil]]) — Latin America's largest economy, China's top trade partner in the region
- [[Gustavo Petro]] ([[Colombia]])
- [[Claudia Sheinbaum]] ([[Mexico]])

The exclusion of Brazil and Mexico — the two largest Latin American economies — limits the summit's practical impact on the China question.

## The Structural Problem

The TikTok analysis (Brazilian Portuguese, transcribed February 22) and Politico (February 19) both identify the same core tension:

1. **Trump treats Latin America as a threat source** (immigrants, drugs, crime), not a partner. His primary tool is coercion — tariffs, sanctions, visa restrictions (see [[Chile-China Cable Sanctions]]).

2. **China is already the #1 trade partner** for most of South America. Over two decades, Beijing built influence through infrastructure investment, trade deals, and financing with no political strings.

3. **The US offer is weak.** Without large-scale investment, Latin American countries have no incentive to distance from Beijing. The Argentina deal (reported) is deeply asymmetric with limited benefits for Buenos Aires.

4. **Ideological alliances are unstable.** Governments change in both the US and Latin America. Alignment based on shared conservative politics doesn't survive election cycles. Durable influence requires institutional arrangements that transcend ideology.

Per Politico: "efforts to persuade Latin American countries to reduce their economic ties to China are likely to flounder unless the U.S." offers concrete alternatives (confirmed, White House official acknowledged the challenge).

## The China Position in Latin America

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| China trade role | #1 partner for most of South America |
| Key sectors | Ports, mining, energy, telecom, agriculture |
| Recent flashpoint | [[Chile-China Express]] submarine cable — US sanctioned Chilean officials |
| Strategic infrastructure | Chancay port (Peru), multiple deep-water ports |
| LATAM trade with China | Growing for 20+ years while US share declined |

## What to Watch (March 7)

- Does Trump signal investment or only demand loyalty?
- Is there a concrete counter-China economic package (infrastructure, trade deals)?
- How do absent leaders (Lula, Sheinbaum, Petro) respond publicly?
- Does Argentina's Milei receive a preferential deal as a reward for alignment?
- Any commitments on Chinese telecom/infrastructure (Huawei, submarine cables)?
