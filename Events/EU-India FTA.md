# EU-India Free Trade Agreement

## Overview
Free trade agreement between the [[European Union]] and [[India]], negotiations concluded January 27, 2026 at Hyderabad House, New Delhi. The EU's largest trade deal by population covered (~2 billion people, ~25% of global GDP). Negotiations launched in 2007, stalled in 2013, relaunched June 2022, concluded after a final overnight push January 26-27. Structured as an EU-only agreement (not requiring member state parliament ratification), avoiding the delays that plagued [[CETA]].

(per S&P Global, EU Commission)

### Intellectual Property

- Recognizes India's Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (protecting against bio-piracy patents)
- Generic pharmaceutical industry protections preserved

(per EU Commission chapter-by-chapter summary)

### Digital Trade and Data
- Partial resolution on cross-border data flows; full EU data adequacy not granted
- India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (2023) provides GDPR-aligned framework but data localization requirements remain

(per VIF, India Briefing)

### Not Included in This FTA
- **Investment Protection Agreement** -- separate, parallel negotiations still ongoing
- **Geographical Indications Agreement** -- separate, still ongoing
- **Government procurement** -- excluded entirely (India refused)
- **Energy and critical minerals chapters** -- not included

(per EU trade policy page, Vajirao & Ravi)

## Structure

**24 negotiating chapters** including: trade in goods, trade in services, TBT, trade remedies, IPR, digital trade, trade and sustainable development, labor standards, SMEs, rules of origin, dispute settlement.

**EU-only agreement** (not a mixed agreement):

| Requirement | EU-Only (this FTA) | Mixed (e.g. CETA) |
|---|---|---|
| Council of the EU | Required | Required |
| European Parliament | Required | Required |
| Member state parliaments | **Not required** | Required (all 27) |
| Typical timeline | 12-18 months | Years (CETA took 7+) |

India side requires approval of the Union Council of Ministers. India does not practice provisional application.

**Ratification risk**: Herbert Smith Freehills noted that European Parliament consent "is by no means assured, if the Mercosur experience is any indication." Entry into force unlikely before early 2027.

**22-year safeguard transition period** -- the longest the EU has agreed in any FTA to date.

(per Sullivan & Cromwell, Herbert Smith Freehills)

## Tariff Liberalization

**EU side:**
- 70.4% of tariff lines eliminated immediately at entry into force (covering 90.7% of India's export value)
- Overall: 99.5% of EU tariff lines liberalized

**India side:**
- 49.6% of tariff lines duty-free immediately (covering 30.6% of trade value)
- 39.5% phased over 5/7/10 years (covering 63.1% of trade value)
- Overall: India eliminates or reduces duties on 96.6% of EU goods exports

(per EU Commission factsheet, India Commerce Ministry factsheet)

## Trade Data

| Metric | Figure |
|--------|--------|
| EU-India goods trade (FY2025) | $136.5 billion |
| Indian exports to EU (FY2025) | $76 billion |
| EU exports to India (FY2025) | $60 billion |
| India-US trade (FY2025) | $132 billion |
| Combined market size | ~$27 trillion, 2 billion people |
| EU-India services trade (2024) | ~$78B (India exports $44B, EU exports $34B) |
| Target bilateral trade by 2030 | ~$200 billion |
| Trade growth 2020→2025 | $74B → $136.5B (+84%) |

The EU is India's largest trading partner at 11.5% of India's total trade.

(per The Corner, Al Jazeera; note: figures vary by source depending on calendar vs. fiscal year and currency)

## Strategic Context

### Trump Factor
The deal accelerated after US protectionism intensified:
- Successive tariff rounds brought combined US duties on Indian goods to approximately 50%
- 25% tariffs specifically targeting India's purchases of Russian oil for refining and re-export
- Both EU and India hedging against US trade war

The European Policy Centre argues the deal was "less about economics or diplomacy than about geopolitics" (EPC analysis, January 2026).

**Trump's counter-move**: Within one week, Trump announced a US-India trade deal on February 3, 2026 (cutting main US tariff from 25% to 18%, removing the Russian-oil tariff) -- widely interpreted as a competitive response to the EU-India FTA (per CNBC, Al Jazeera).

### India's Shift on FTAs
India has historically been protectionist: trade deficits widened with every FTA partner ($54B in 2013-14 to $105B in 2018-19). India withdrew from RCEP in 2019. The BJP opposed this very FTA in 2013.

What changed: Trump's tariffs created urgent diversification need; structural protections (dairy, beef, sugar excluded) made it politically viable in a way RCEP was not; India's growing confidence as alternative manufacturing hub to China. Between FY 2020-21 and FY 2024-25, India's trade with FTA partner countries rose 92%, far outpacing 41.5% growth in India's global trade (per India Briefing).

**India's bilateral FTA strategy:**

| Agreement | Partner | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| ECTA | Australia | In force Dec 2022; bilateral trade up 96% |
| TEPA | EFTA | In force Oct 2025; $100B EFTA investment pledge |
| Services-First Pact | UK | Signed July 24, 2025 |
| FTA | EU | Concluded Jan 27, 2026 |
| Trade Deal | US | Announced Feb 3, 2026 (tariff cut 25%→18%) |

(per Foreign Policy, Lowy Institute, India Briefing, Republic World)

### Security Dimension
The 16th India-EU Summit (January 2026) also delivered an upgraded security and defense partnership, placing India's EU security ties on par with Japan and South Korea.

### Broader EU Trade Strategy
The EU concluded both EU-Mercosur (January 17) and EU-India (January 27) within the same month -- demonstrating capacity to deliver major deals with democratic partners while maintaining sustainability standards, in implicit contrast to Trump's bilateral protectionism. The EU-India model is seen as a template for future deals with Indonesia, the Philippines, and others (per Frost & Sullivan).

## Key Sticking Points and Resolutions

| Issue | EU Position | India Position | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Auto tariffs | Deep cuts in India's 110% tariffs | Protect domestic auto industry | Phased reduction to 10% over 5-10 years with quota system |
| Wine/spirits | Tariff elimination | Protect domestic grape farmers | Reduction (not elimination) over 7 years; EUR 2.50 price floor protects cheap domestic wine |
| Dairy | Market access | Protect 80+ million dairy farmers | Complete exclusion |
| Services/Mode 4 | Restrictive on professional mobility | Visa liberalization for IT professionals | Framework for temporary entry; Social Security Agreements within 5 years |
| Data localization | Free cross-border data flows | Data sovereignty under DPDP Act (2023) | Partial; improved flow provisions but no full data adequacy |
| Government procurement | Access to Indian public contracts | Protect "Make in India" local-preference policies | Excluded entirely |
| Geographical indications | Comprehensive GI protections | Resistance to European GI claims | Carved out into separate negotiations |
| IPR | TRIPS-plus protections | Protect generic pharma industry | Reinforces TRIPS; affirms Doha Declaration; recognizes Traditional Knowledge Digital Library |
| Investment protection | Investor-state dispute settlement | Sovereignty over regulatory space | Carved out into separate negotiations |

(per VIF, India Briefing, European Parliament)

## Opposition

### EU Farmers
Exclusion of dairy, beef, chicken, rice, and sugar significantly reduced opposition compared to EU-Mercosur. EU farmers reportedly viewed the India deal more favorably (per Brussels Signal).

### Indian Domestic
- BJP opposed this same FTA in 2013 when in opposition -- raising consistency questions
- Concerns about European auto competition displacing Indian manufacturers
- Government immediately clarified dairy would "never be opened up"

(per Zee News)
