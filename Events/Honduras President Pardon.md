# Honduras President Pardon (December 2025)

## Overview
On December 1, 2025, President Trump pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras, who had been convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to 45 years in federal prison. The pardon contradicts the administration's stated rationale for the Venezuela intervention (combating drug flows) and drew sharp bipartisan criticism.

## Key Facts
- **Who**: Juan Orlando Hernández, President of Honduras 2014-2022
- **Conviction**: Drug trafficking, weapons offenses (March 2024)
- **Sentence**: 45 years in federal prison (June 2024)
- **Pardon date**: December 1, 2025
- **Released from**: U.S. Penitentiary Hazelton, West Virginia

## The Conviction

### Charges
Hernández was convicted of helping drug traffickers import **over 400 tons of cocaine** into the United States while accepting bribes to fuel his political career and protecting violent cartel leaders from prosecution.

### Key Evidence
- Received campaign contributions from drug traffickers
- Accepted bribes from Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán (Sinaloa Cartel leader)
- Used presidential position to facilitate trafficking operations
- Protected cartel leaders from prosecution in Honduras

### Legal Process
- Extradited to US: April 2022
- Trial: Three-week jury trial, March 2024
- Conviction: March 2024
- Sentencing: 45 years, June 2024
- Then-AG Merrick Garland: Hernández supported "one of the largest and most violent drug trafficking conspiracies in the world"

## Trump's Justification

Trump called the prosecution a "Biden horrible witch hunt" and a "setup," claiming without evidence that it was politically motivated.

> "If somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life."

## Political Context

### Lobbying
- Roger Stone lobbied Trump for the pardon (called on Trump in June 2025)
- Connected to Hernández's National Party in Honduras

### Electoral Interference
Trump announced pardon plans while endorsing Nasry "Tito" Asfura, the National Party's presidential candidate, seemingly conditioning US support for Honduras on Asfura's victory.

## The Contradiction

Kori Schake (AEI) highlighted this as evidence of policy incoherence:

> "The president pardoned the convicted president of Honduras, who had been convicted for drug trafficking. So how do those two things connect?"

| Action | Stated Rationale | Actual Effect |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Venezuela intervention | Drug/cartel nexus | Removed Maduro |
| Honduras pardon | "Witch hunt" | Freed convicted trafficker of 400+ tons cocaine |

This suggests drug trafficking is **not** the actual driver of Latin America policy—other factors (regime alignment, political relationships, electoral interference) explain the inconsistency.

## Aftermath

### Honduras Response
- Attorney General Johel Zelaya ordered arrest
- Requested Interpol warrant
- Reactivated domestic charges (fraud, money laundering)
- Hernández faces arrest if he returns to Honduras

### Congressional Response
- Resolutions condemning pardon introduced in both chambers
- H.Res. 929 (House)
- S.Res. 530 (Senate)
- Bipartisan criticism

### Implications
- Undermines credibility of counter-narcotics justifications
- Signals US enforcement is political, not principled
- Damages relations with Honduran government
- Emboldens corrupt actors in region
