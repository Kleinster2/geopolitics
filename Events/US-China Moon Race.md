# US-China Moon Race

## Overview
The United States and China are engaged in a strategic competition to establish human presence and influence on the Moon, particularly at the resource-rich lunar south pole. This competition extends beyond national prestige to questions of who sets the rules for space governance, resource access, and technological leadership for decades to come.

## The Stakes

### Why It Matters
Per Allen Cutler (Coalition for Deep Space Exploration): the country that lands on the moon first will shape the rules of engagement in space going forward.

Key stakes include:
- **Norm-setting**: Who establishes governance frameworks for lunar activity
- **Resource access**: Water ice at lunar poles enables sustained presence
- **Technological leadership**: Demonstration of advanced capabilities
- **Alliance architecture**: Two competing international frameworks emerging

### Lunar South Pole Focus
Both programs target the lunar south pole, specifically the rim of **Shackleton Crater**:
- Permanently shadowed craters contain water ice
- Water can be converted to rocket fuel and life support
- Only crater rims offer viable landing sites
- **Potential conflict**: Both US Artemis III and China's Chang'e 7/8 may target the same locations

## US: Artemis Program

### Current Status (February 2026)
- **Artemis II**: Crewed lunar flyby mission, targeting launch February 8, 2026 (delayed from earlier dates due to cold weather at launch site)
- **Artemis III**: First crewed lunar landing since Apollo, timeline uncertain (originally 2025, repeatedly delayed)
- **Crew**: Reid Wiseman, Christina Koch, Victor Glover (US), Jeremy Hansen (Canada)
- Artemis II will carry four astronauts on a 10-day flyby, farthest humans have traveled since Apollo

### Artemis Accords
US-led international framework for lunar cooperation:
- Open, multilateral approach contrasting with China's model
- Partners can operate within shared framework
- **Key feature**: Designed so companies and countries can participate
- No Artemis signatory has joined China's ILRS; no ILRS member has signed Artemis Accords (except Thailand, partial overlap)

### Challenges
- Repeated delays have raised doubts about timeline
- Per RAND (October 2025): growing doubts that NASA can beat China to a crewed lunar landing
- Relies on commercial partners (SpaceX Starship for landing)
- Budget constraints and political uncertainty

## China: Lunar Exploration Program

### Robotic Missions

**Chang'e 7 (2026)**
- Launch: Second half of 2026
- Target: Shackleton Crater rim, lunar south pole
- Mission: Orbiter, lander, rover, mini-flying probe
- Goal: Study water ice and volatile resources
- Includes six international scientific instruments (ESA, France, Italy, Pakistan payloads)

**Chang'e 8 (2028-2029)**
- 200 kg of international payload capacity
- Will test in-situ resource utilization (ISRU)
- 3D printing experiment using lunar materials
- Sealed ecosystem experiment
- Foundation for ILRS construction

### Crewed Landing
- Target: 2030 for crewed lunar landing
- **Long March 10**: Superheavy rocket in development
- **Lanyue**: Lunar lander under development (recent test landing sparked debate over China's timeline)
- Spacesuit development underway

### Assessment
China's program characterized as "deliberate, well-resourced and focused on establishing a long-term presence" (PBS). Has already achieved:
- First landing on lunar far side
- Lunar sample return missions

## International Lunar Research Station (ILRS)

### Structure
China-Russia led alternative to Artemis framework:
- **Phase 1**: Basic station by 2035
- **Phase 2**: Expanded version by 2045
- Long-term robotic operation with periodic human visits

### Partnership Model
- **"5-5-5" Campaign**: Target of 50 nations, 500 institutions, 5,000 researchers by early 2030s
- 13 countries signed on: Russia, Pakistan, Belarus, South Africa, others
- 40+ institutions have signed cooperation documents
- Centrally directed, tightly controlled by state
- Fewer details released publicly compared to Artemis

### Geopolitical Dimension
Two separate lunar frameworks with almost no overlap in membership creates potential for:
- Competing norms on resource extraction
- Different technical standards
- Parallel infrastructure

## Timeline Comparison

| Milestone | United States | China |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Crewed lunar orbit | Feb 2026 (Artemis II) | -- |
| Robotic south pole | 2025 (commercial landers) | 2026 (Chang'e 7) |
| ISRU demonstration | TBD | 2028 (Chang'e 8) |
| Crewed landing | TBD (Artemis III) | ~2030 |
| Permanent presence | 2030s (Artemis Base Camp) | 2035 (ILRS basic) |

## Strategic Implications

### For US-China Relations
- Extension of technological competition to new domain
- Prestige implications for both great powers
- Potential friction over south pole access

### For International Order
- Two competing alliance structures emerging in space
- Questions about applicability of existing space law
- Resource extraction norms undefined

### For Third Countries
- Must choose between frameworks or navigate both
- Technology transfer and cooperation opportunities
- India notably courted by both sides
