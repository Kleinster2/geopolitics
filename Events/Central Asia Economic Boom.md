# Central Asia Economic Boom

## Overview
Central Asia is experiencing its strongest growth in over a decade, driven by converging structural factors: post-sanctions trade redirection, record Chinese BRI investment, energy transition demand for the region's critical minerals, and infrastructure connectivity projects (CKU railway, Middle Corridor) reducing Russia-dependency. The Eurasian Development Bank reports regional GDP growth of approximately 6.6% in 2025, projected at 6.1% in 2026. The EU, US, Turkey, and China are all competing for influence, giving Central Asian states unprecedented leverage.

**Key caveat** (per Euronews, January 2026): Many households face rising prices, high borrowing costs, and uneven income gains. Inflation and monetary tightening shape day-to-day reality more than headline GDP figures.

## GDP Growth by Country

| Country | 2024 (est.) | 2025 (EDB) | 2026 (EDB) | Notes |
|---------|------------|------------|------------|-------|
| Kazakhstan | ~5.1% | 5.9% | 5.5% | Tengiz oil field expansion |
| Uzbekistan | ~6.0% | 7.4% | 6.8% | Fixed capital investment up 15.2% YoY |
| Kyrgyzstan | ~8.5% | 10.3% | 9.3% | Fastest acceleration; gold prices |
| Tajikistan | 8.4% | 8.3% | 8.1% | Remittances peaked at 49% of GDP (2024) |
| Turkmenistan | 6.3% (official); 3.0% (IMF) | 6.3% (ADB) | 6.0% (ADB) | Significant divergence between official and IMF estimates |

World Bank forecasts a sharper slowdown to ~5.0% in 2026 and 4.6% in 2027.

## Sanctions Arbitrage

Central Asian countries have become key conduits for Western goods reaching [[Russia]] following post-2022 sanctions.

**Trade surge data (per FPRI, Oxford Economics, CEPA):**
- Kazakhstan's exports to Russia increased 30% in 2022; Kyrgyzstan's exports increased 150%
- Kazakh companies exported approximately EUR 550 million in electronic equipment to Russia (Jan-Oct 2022) -- 18x the 2021 level
- Exports of 45 specified dual-use goods from the region reached $1.3 billion in 2023 (+64% over 2022)

**Mechanism**: The Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) enables free movement of goods, allowing sanctioned products to transit through member states. Per the KIAR Center: evidence suggests the surge involves Chinese goods deliberately routed through the region.

**Western enforcement**: In June 2024, the US sanctioned three entities for procuring industrial goods for Russia; the EU imposed sanctions on companies from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan (per FPRI).

## China-Central Asia Trade

| Year | Volume | Change |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2022 | ~$70 billion (est.) | Post-sanctions surge begins |
| 2023 | $89.4 billion | +27% YoY |
| 2024 | $94.82 billion | +6.8% |
| 2025 | $106.3 billion | +12% (new record) |

China became Central Asia's largest trading partner for the first time in 2025 (per Astana Times, Chinese government statistics).

**Major Chinese investments:**
- Kazakhstan: $23 billion in first half of 2025 alone; $12B aluminum complex (East Hope Group); $7.5B in copper
- Uzbekistan: 500 MW solar plant (Jizzakh); 1,000 MW wind farm (Karakalpakstan)

**Growing trade imbalance**: Kazakhstan's trade deficit with China quadrupled in the first half of 2025, reaching $1.8 billion (vs. $400 million for all of 2024), raising dependency concerns (per Astana Times).

**Gas dependency**: China is the main importer of Uzbek gas (80%+ share). Turkmenistan's gas exports to China account for over two-thirds of total exports (three pipelines, 55 bcm capacity; fourth line adding 15 bcm).

## CKU Railway (China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan)

**Route**: 523 km total -- 213 km in China, 260 km in Kyrgyzstan, 50 km in Uzbekistan. Bypasses Russia entirely.

**Status**: Construction ceremony in Jalal-Abad, December 2024. Tunnel construction on Kyrgyz section began May 2025 (three critical tunnels: Fergana Mountain, Naryn No. 1, Koshtet).

**Financing**: Total cost $4.7 billion. China approved $2.3 billion concessional loan (35-year term). Remaining from joint venture capital (51% China). Financial agreement signed December 16, 2025.

**Completion**: Targeted 2029; mountainous terrain may extend timeline. Initial specification: single-track, non-electrified (electrification planned for second phase).

**Significance** (per Caspian Policy Center): A major piece of the emerging sanctions-resistant, Russia-alternative trade architecture.

(per The Diplomat, News Central Asia, Eurasianet, Caspian Policy Center)

## Middle Corridor (Trans-Caspian)

Cargo via the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route (TITR) is surging:
- China goods via TITR: ~1,080 TEU (2023) to **27,000 TEU** (2024) -- 25x increase
- Mangistau Region cargo: 2.5 million tons in 2025 (+20%)
- Azerbaijan Railways plans to triple block trains along TITR to 1,000 in 2025

**Caspian bottleneck**: Kazakhstan plans six ferries between Kuryk and Alat (Azerbaijan), two entering service first half of 2026.

**EU investment**: EUR 10.4M for Aktau Port modernization; EUR 150M EIB loan for road rehabilitation.

## Great Power Competition

### Russia's Declining Influence
Per Hudson Institute, FPRI: Russia's power and legitimacy in Central Asia has declined in absolute terms since February 2022. Western sanctions and demographic problems reduced Moscow's capacity to fund programs. China's military exports to the region rose from 1.5% (2010-2014) to 18% (2015-2019). Central Asian nations are "turning away" from Russia for arms purchases (per Breaking Defense, November 2024). Russia maintains bases in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan (Kant), and Tajikistan (201st Military Base), but the CSTO is increasingly viewed as hollow.

**Migration crackdown**: After the Crocus City Hall attack (March 2024, perpetrated by radicalized ethnic Tajiks), Russia nearly doubled forced deportations. Tajik workers in St. Petersburg fell 60% since April 2024; Uzbek workers fell 40% (per Caspian Policy Center). Alternative destinations growing: South Korea increased Uzbek worker quota to 100,000; UAE raised its limit to 1 million; Saudi Arabia opened 100,000 jobs.

### Turkey's Rising Role
- Organization of Turkic States (OTS) trade reached $58.17 billion in 2024 (up from $38.3B in 2023)
- $600 million Turkic Investment Fund mobilizing
- First joint OTS military exercises planned for 2026
- Turkish companies invested $5+ billion in Uzbekistan
- Cultural diplomacy: Yunus Emre Institute, TIKA, Turkiye Scholarships, World Nomad Games

(per Astana Times, Daily Sabah, SWP Berlin)

### EU Global Gateway
**Samarkand Summit (April 4, 2025)**: First-ever EU-Central Asia summit at head-of-state level. Upgraded to strategic partnership.

**EUR 12 billion** (~$13.2B) package:
- EUR 3B for transport
- EUR 2.5B for critical raw materials
- EUR 6.4B for water, energy, climate
- Specific projects: EUR 100M Tajikistan transport; EUR 365M EIB across three countries; EUR 200M Kazakhstan framework loan

(per EU Council, Astana Times, EIB)

### US Engagement (C5+1)
**November 6, 2025 summit** in Washington: First-ever C5+1 **Presidential Summit**, elevating the format from Secretary-level to head-of-state level. Over $130 billion in commercial commitments. Inaugural C5+1 Critical Minerals Dialogue (May 22, 2025). Joint Statement of Intent on Economic Cooperation covering commercial environment, trade/investment/critical minerals, and Trans-Caspian connectivity. Rubio pledged to visit all five countries in 2026. Consideration of repealing Jackson-Vanik restrictions. Trump invited Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to 2026 G20.

Per The Diplomat (November 2025): potential shift from multilateral "C5+1" to five bilateral "C1+1" relationships, reflecting the Trump administration's transactional approach.

(per Jamestown Foundation, The Diplomat, CSIS, Astana Times)

## Energy and Critical Minerals

### Oil and Gas
- **Kazakhstan**: Production rising to 96.2M tons in 2025 (+10%); Chevron Tengiz FGP adds 260,000 bpd; Kashagan targeting 450,000 bpd by Q3 2026
- **Turkmenistan**: Gas exports to China outearn Russia's gas supplies to China; TAPI pipeline remains unrealized

### Uranium
- **Kazakhstan**: World's largest producer; Kazatomprom produced 23,270 tU3O8 in 2024 (+10% YoY), accounting for ~21% of global primary output (all Kazakhstan-based enterprises: ~39%); 43% of world uranium reserves; supplied 24% of US reactor uranium
- **Uzbekistan**: Fifth globally (~7% of global supply); 9% of US reactor uranium; planning first nuclear power plant with Rosatom (2 VVER-1000 + 2 RITM-200N SMRs, excavation began October 2025) — would become first country to operate large-scale and small-scale nuclear reactors simultaneously

### Other Critical Minerals
Kazakhstan holds reserves of 21 of 34 EU-listed critical raw materials; world's largest chromium reserves; titanium, silver, lead, copper.

EU committed $2.9B under Global Gateway for critical minerals exploration (spring 2025). France's Orano holds 51% of KATCO uranium company and committed $500M for Uzbekistan extraction.

## Key Risks

### Water Stress
- 22 million people (~1/3 of population) lack safe water access
- Tien Shan glaciers lost ~25% of mass; models predict 50% loss within 25 years
- Amu Darya and Syr Darya show 20% atrophy; 90% decline in Aral Sea
- Kazakhstan's wheat harvest reduced 26% in 2024; March 2025 heatwave struck during flowering period for Uzbek fruit crops and Kazakh spring wheat
- Economic impact of droughts/floods could reach 1.3% of regional GDP annually
- **Rogun Dam** (Tajikistan): Would be world's highest embankment dam (280-335m), 3,600 MW capacity; two of six turbines completed; Uzbekistan committed (June 2022) to import Rogun energy — a dramatic reversal from the Karimov era's hostility
- **Central Asian Gas Ring** proposed to link gas networks of all five states, reducing hydropower dependency and mitigating seasonal water management conflicts

(per Caspian Policy Center, Atlantic Council, Clingendael, SpecialEurasia)

### Authoritarian Governance
- Uzbekistan's Mirziyoyev used constitutional referendum to extend power beyond term limits
- Kazakhstan's Tokayev-era reforms assessed as largely symbolic
- Kyrgyzstan's "Khanstitution" (2021) entrenching executive authority

(per Yale Journal of International Affairs, Foreign Policy Centre)

### Remittance Vulnerability
- Tajikistan remittances: 49% of GDP; Kyrgyzstan: 24%
- Russia's migration crackdowns threatening flows; remittances to region declined 10% (~$71B) in 2023
- Country breakdown: Uzbekistan remittances fell 42%, Kyrgyzstan 12%, Tajikistan 8% in 2023 -- driven partly by 39% ruble depreciation
- Uzbekistan still receives 77% of remittances from Russia
- Garment industry that boomed on Russia trade redirection in 2022-2023 declined in 2025 amid new Russian restrictions -- illustrating the transience of sanctions-driven growth

(per World Bank, IOM, Caspian Policy Center, Carnegie)

### Secondary Sanctions Risk
Sanctions arbitrage enriches intermediaries but exposes Central Asian states to Western secondary sanctions enforcement.

## Assessment

The key analytical question is whether the region can convert this geopolitical windfall into durable economic diversification, or whether it represents a temporary boom driven by transient factors (sanctions arbitrage, commodity prices, great-power competition).
