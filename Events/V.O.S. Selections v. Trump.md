# V.O.S. Selections v. Trump

## Summary
Consolidated Supreme Court case (with Learning Resources v. Trump) challenging the president's authority to impose tariffs using the [[IEEPA|International Emergency Economic Powers Act]]. Lower courts unanimously ruled IEEPA does not authorize tariffs. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on November 5, 2025, with justices broadly skeptical of the government's position. Decision expected by mid-2026.

## The Plaintiffs

### V.O.S. Selections (Lead Plaintiff)
V.O.S. Selections is a family-owned wine and spirits importer based in New York City, founded by Victor Schwartz in 1987 and now operated with his daughter Chloe Schwartz. The company was represented by the Liberty Justice Center.

### Other Business Plaintiffs
Five small businesses challenged the IEEPA tariffs in the CIT case:
- **V.O.S. Selections** (New York) -- wine and spirits importer
- **FishUSA** (Pennsylvania) -- fishing gear retailer and wholesaler
- **MicroKits** (Virginia) -- children's electricity learning kit maker
- **Terry Precision Cycling** (Vermont) -- women's cycling apparel
- **Genova Pipe** (Utah) -- plastics producer

### State Plaintiffs
Oregon led a coalition of state attorneys general including Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, and New Mexico.

### Learning Resources (Companion Case)
Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc. -- educational toy manufacturers -- filed a separate challenge in the D.C. District Court on April 22, 2025.

## Legal Questions

### Primary Question
Does IEEPA authorize the president to impose tariffs on imported goods?

### Secondary Question
If IEEPA does authorize tariffs, does the statute constitute an unconstitutional delegation of Congress's taxing power to the executive branch, given the Taxing and Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8)?

### Three Constitutional Doctrines at Issue

1. **Statutory interpretation**: Does "regulate... importation" encompass the power to impose tariffs/duties?
2. **Major questions doctrine**: Does an action of such vast economic significance require clear congressional authorization?
3. **Nondelegation doctrine**: Does IEEPA place sufficient constraints on presidential authority to pass constitutional muster?

## Timeline

### Lower Court Proceedings
- **February 7, 2025**: Trump imposes IEEPA tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China (citing fentanyl trafficking)
- **April 2, 2025**: "Liberation Day" -- global reciprocal tariffs imposed under IEEPA
- **April 22, 2025**: Learning Resources files suit in D.C. District Court
- **May 28, 2025**: Court of International Trade (three-judge panel) grants summary judgment to V.O.S. Selections plaintiffs; permanently enjoins enforcement; rules IEEPA does not authorize tariffs
- **May 29, 2025**: D.C. District Court (Judge Contreras) grants preliminary injunction in Learning Resources; reaches same conclusion on IEEPA authority
- **August 29, 2025**: Federal Circuit (en banc, 7-4) affirms CIT ruling; holds IEEPA lacks tariff authority; invokes major questions doctrine; stays decision until October 14

### Supreme Court Proceedings
- **September 9, 2025**: Supreme Court grants certiorari in both cases and consolidates them
- **November 5, 2025**: Nearly three hours of oral argument
- **Decision pending**: Expected by mid-2026; earliest possible date February 20, 2026

## Federal Circuit Opinion (August 29, 2025)

### Vote
7-4 en banc decision affirming the CIT.

### Key Holdings
1. IEEPA's authorization to "regulate... importation" does not grant authority to impose tariffs "unbounded in scope, amount, and duration"
2. Other statutes delegating tariff authority use explicit tariff/duty/tax language and include procedural constraints -- IEEPA has neither
3. The tariffs violate the **major questions doctrine** -- described as "unheralded" and "transformative" with "immense economic and political significance," requiring clear congressional authorization that IEEPA does not provide
4. Vacated the CIT's universal permanent injunction and remanded for reconsideration of remedy scope

## Supreme Court Oral Arguments (November 5, 2025)

### Government's Position
Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued IEEPA's broad language ("regulate... importation") encompasses tariff authority, consistent with the president's emergency powers and foreign affairs role.

### Justices' Reception
Broad skepticism from both liberal and conservative justices:

| Bloc | Posture |
|------|---------|
| Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson | Skeptical that IEEPA grants tariff authority |
| Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett | Probed both sides carefully; potentially decisive votes |
| Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh | More open to government arguments, but still questioning |

### Central Tension
Justices repeatedly pressed the government to identify explicit statutory language authorizing tariffs. The statute empowers the president to "regulate or prohibit" imports but never mentions "tariffs," "duties," or "taxes."

Several justices emphasized that the power to impose tariffs is fundamentally a power to tax, reserved to Congress under Article I.

## Stakes

### If Tariffs Struck Down
- Importers may seek refunds on billions in duties paid since April 2025
- CIT ruled in December 2025 that reliquidation remains available even after entry liquidation
- Administration would need to seek congressional authorization for tariff program
- Existing tariffs under other authorities (Section 232, Section 301) would be unaffected

### If Tariffs Upheld
- Validates unprecedented expansion of presidential emergency economic powers
- Sets precedent for future presidents to bypass Congress on trade policy
- IEEPA becomes a general-purpose tariff authority

### Fiscal Scale
- IEEPA tariffs have generated an estimated $75-85 billion in revenue since April 2025
- Potential refund liability of similar magnitude if struck down

## Analysis

The conventional wisdom after oral argument holds that a majority of justices appear skeptical of the government's position. The key question may not be whether the tariffs are struck down, but how narrowly or broadly the Court writes its opinion -- and whether it reaches the nondelegation question or resolves the case on statutory interpretation alone.

The delay in issuing the opinion (still pending as of February 2026) has been noted by observers. Per SCOTUSblog (January 2026), the justices have not signaled they regard this as the kind of emergency requiring expedited resolution, despite significant economic stakes.
