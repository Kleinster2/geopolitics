# Myanmar Rare Earths

## Overview

Northern [[Myanmar]]'s Kachin State contains some of the world's most valuable deposits of heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), particularly dysprosium and terbium. These minerals are essential for permanent magnets used in defense systems, electric vehicles, and wind turbines. The [[Kachin Independence Organization]] (KIO) seized control of virtually all mining sites in October 2024, disrupting a supply chain that had provided China with approximately 98% of its heavy rare earth imports. The situation sits at the intersection of Myanmar's civil war, US-China tech competition, and the global energy transition.

## Location and Deposits

### Geography
Mining is concentrated in Chipwi and Pangwa townships in northern Kachin State, along the China-Yunnan border. The deposits are ion-adsorption clay type, enriched in heavy rare earths.

### Scale
- **Mining sites**: Approximately 130 active sites in 2020, rising to over 370 by end of 2024 (per ISP-Myanmar)
- **Leaching pits**: Over 2,500 recorded in Chipwi alone, with 5,000+ smaller sites across Chipwi and Pangwa (per ISP-Myanmar)
- **Production**: Myanmar produced approximately 31,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides in 2024, up from approximately 12,000 metric tons in 2022 (per USGS estimates)
- **Exports to China (2017-2024)**: Over 290,000 tons of rare earth material, total value exceeding USD 4.2 billion; 85% of that value generated after the February 2021 coup (per ISP-Myanmar)
- **2025 exports**: USD 620 million worth of rare earths exported to China (per ISP-Myanmar)
- Myanmar is the world's third-largest producer of rare earth elements, behind China and the United States

### Why Heavy Rare Earths Matter
Heavy rare earths (dysprosium, terbium, lutetium, yttrium, and others) are distinct from light rare earths (neodymium, praseodymium) in scarcity and application:

| Element | Key Applications | Why Critical |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| Dysprosium | Heat-resistant permanent magnets | Enables magnets to function at high temperatures in jet engines, missile guidance |
| Terbium | Permanent magnets, solid-state devices | Complementary to dysprosium in magnet performance |

Approximately 60% of global dysprosium and terbium comes from mining in Kachin State (per EarthRights International, April 2025).

### Defense Applications
Rare earth permanent magnets (NdFeB type, doped with dysprosium/terbium) are required for:
- **F-35 Lightning II**: Requires approximately 920 pounds of rare earth materials per aircraft (per Finabel), used in electric actuation systems, radar, and engine components
- **Virginia-class and Columbia-class submarines**: Propulsion and electronics
- **Tomahawk cruise missiles**: Guidance systems
- **Predator UAVs**: Motors and sensors
- **JDAM smart bombs**: Guidance
- **Satellite systems**: Communications and positioning

## KIO Control

### Pre-2024: NDA-K and Militia Era
Before the KIO seizure, mining was controlled by the **New Democratic Army - Kachin (NDA-K)**, a junta-aligned militia that signed a ceasefire with the Tatmadaw in 1989 and was converted into a Border Guard Force (BGF) in 2009. The NDA-K leased mines to Chinese companies, provided security, and taxed exports. Mining expanded dramatically after the 2021 coup as China reduced domestic extraction and outsourced to Myanmar.

### October 2024 Seizure
As part of wider **Operation 0307**, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA, the KIO's military wing) captured:
- **Chipwi and Hsawlaw**: Seized September 29 - October 2, 2024
- **Pangwa**: Captured October 19, 2024 (key rare earth mining hub and border trading town)
- **BGF Battalions 1002 and 1003**: Taken from NDA-K in October 2024

By late November 2024, the KIA had taken control of virtually all mining areas and border trading points in the rare earth belt.

### Post-Seizure: KIO as Gatekeeper
The KIO initially paused mining operations and began renegotiating terms with Chinese companies. Per Frontier Myanmar (2025), the KIO is:
- Imposing a fixed tax per tonne of rare earth concentrate exports
- Formulating new regulations for rare earth mining
- Engaging directly with Chinese authorities on cross-border trade
- Considering environmental governance measures

China initially closed the border after the KIA seizure. After negotiations between the KIA and Chinese government representatives, cross-border trade resumed in early 2025 under new KIO-set terms.

The KIO funds its broader operations through taxation, control of natural resource extraction (jade, gold, timber, rare earths), and cross-border trade with China.

### Revenue
The mining area generated over USD 4.2 billion in export value over eight years (2017-2024), per ISP-Myanmar. The KIO's specific share is not publicly confirmed, but as the new gatekeeper collecting taxes on all exports, it now captures a significant portion.

## China Nexus

### Supply Chain Structure
1. **Extraction**: Chinese companies operate mines in Kachin State using in-situ leaching
2. **Initial processing**: Raw material converted to rare earth oxides at site (using firewood-fueled furnaces)
3. **Export**: Oxides transported across border to Yunnan Province
4. **Separation and refining**: Processed in Chinese facilities (China controls approximately 91% of global rare earth separation capacity)
5. **Magnet manufacturing**: Final products (NdFeB magnets) produced in China for global sale

### China's Dependence on Myanmar
- In 2023, Myanmar accounted for approximately 98% of China's heavy rare earth imports, totalling over 9,000 tonnes of HREE concentrates (per Global Witness)
- Heavy rare earth oxide imports from Myanmar reached 41,700 tonnes in 2023, up from 19,500 tonnes in 2021
- Myanmar accounted for approximately 57% of China's total rare earth imports in 2024
- China grabbed over 80% of Myanmar's critical mineral exports overall (per 9DashLine)
- By 2024, China imported more critical minerals from Myanmar than it produced domestically for some categories

### Chinese Companies
PRC-based firms expanded rare earth mining in Kachin and Shan States by partnering with local militias (per Jamestown Foundation). Specific named companies are limited in public reporting due to the informal/illicit nature of much of the trade, but operations are described as involving both Chinese state-owned mining conglomerates and smaller private operators.

### China's Export Controls (2025-2026)
China has weaponized its rare earth processing dominance:

| Date | Action | Elements Covered |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| April 2025 | Export controls imposed | Samarium, gadolinium, **terbium**, **dysprosium**, lutetium, scandium, yttrium |
| October 2025 | Additional controls announced | Holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium |
| November 2025 | October controls suspended until November 2026 | Holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium only |
| January 2026 | Dual-use export ban to Japan | Broad categories, strategic ambiguity on specifics |

The April 2025 controls on terbium and dysprosium remain in force and require special export licenses. Per CSIS, dysprosium prices increased 180% within 60 days of implementation, and terbium availability declined 65% for non-Chinese purchasers.

## Environmental Damage

### Mining Method
The extraction uses **in-situ leaching**: vegetation is cleared, holes drilled into hillsides, and ammonium sulfate solution injected to dissolve rare earth elements from ionic clay. The solution drains into collection pools. This method is:
- Environmentally devastating with no regulation in Myanmar
- In China, the same technique is governed by production quotas, standards, and environmental impact assessments; no such regulations exist in Myanmar

### Documented Impacts
- **Deforestation**: From 2018 to 2024, mining townships lost approximately 32,720 hectares (80,850 acres) of tree cover (per Mongabay satellite analysis, September 2025). Forests are cleared both for mine sites and for firewood to fuel drying furnaces.
- **Water contamination**: Rivers turned rust-red; heavy metals and radioactive elements found in waterways. EarthRights International testing showed leachate from a mine abandoned for 10 years still emitted arsenic and cadmium far above safe levels.
- **Health impacts**: Communities near mines report symptoms consistent with those documented near Chinese in-situ leaching mines: osteoporosis, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal problems, skin and eye conditions
- **Landslides**: Injection of water and chemicals into hillsides contributes to slope instability
- **Cross-border pollution**: Unregulated mining has caused pollution reaching into northern Thailand (per Business and Human Rights Resource Centre)

### EarthRights International Report (April 2025)
EarthRights International published "Kachin: A Sacrifice Zone for the Green Transition" documenting widespread environmental and human rights harms. The report called on the KIO to halt mining until safeguards can be established.

## Geopolitical Competition

### India's Engagement with KIO (2025)
After China's April 2025 export controls froze rare earth shipments, India (which depends on China for approximately 80% of its rare earth imports) began exploring direct engagement:
- India's Ministry of Mines directed state-owned IREL India Ltd and private companies to explore procurement from the KIA (per The Diplomat, September 2025)
- In July 2025, a government-led initiative coordinated transfer of rare earth samples for testing in Indian laboratories
- Indian officials reportedly considering strengthening cross-border road connectivity to facilitate access
- This forms part of India's **National Critical Mineral Mission 2025**

### US Interest
- In late July 2025, the Trump administration heard competing proposals to access Myanmar's heavy rare earths (per Reuters/US News, July 28, 2025)
- Options discussed ranged from direct engagement with the junta or KIO to routes via India under a Quad framework
- **July 25, 2025**: US Treasury lifted sanctions on several Myanmar junta-allied entities, raising speculation (denied by officials) that the move was connected to rare earth access (per The Diplomat, August 2025)
- Multiple analysts argue such deals face massive obstacles: sanctions compliance, logistics, Chinese processing dependency, and the reality that mines are controlled by ethnic armies, not the junta

### Quad Framework
India's Quad partners (US, Australia, Japan) have explored using northeast India as an alternative route for Myanmar rare earths processing, though this remains speculative (per Asia Times, December 2025).

### Obstacles to Western Access
The Stimson Center (2025) identified four reasons why proposals to source rare earths from Myanmar will not succeed:
1. US sanctions on Myanmar's military regime block most commercial activity
2. Mining areas are controlled by ethnic armed organizations, not the junta
3. All processing infrastructure is in China; no alternative exists at scale
4. Environmental and human rights concerns create legal and reputational risks

## Sanctions and Legal Framework

### US Sanctions
- Executive Order 14014 sanctions the State Administration Council (SAC) and linked entities
- Any commercial benefit to SAC-linked parties is broadly prohibited
- US Customs and Border Protection can detain shipments with indirect links to sanctioned parties
- Trade finance, dollar clearing, and international insurance effectively blocked

### EU Sanctions
- Restrictive measures renewed until April 30, 2026
- Apply to 106 individuals and 22 entities
- Asset freeze and travel ban provisions

### Practical Effect
Per the Stimson Center, combined international due diligence rules, US sanctions, and financial system barriers create a structural block on compliant rare earth sourcing from Myanmar. The minerals currently have no viable route to Western markets except through Chinese processing.

## Alternative Sources Being Developed

### Lynas Rare Earths (Australia/Malaysia)
- In May 2025, Lynas became the **first company outside China to produce commercial quantities of separated heavy rare earths** (dysprosium first, terbium following in June 2025)
- Announced AUD 180 million investment in Malaysia heavy rare earths facility, processing 5,000 tonnes annually
- Feedstock from wholly-owned Mt Weld deposit in Western Australia
- Now regarded as the largest commercial heavy rare earths separation facility outside China

### MP Materials (United States)
- Operates Mountain Pass mine in California (world's second-largest rare earth mine)
- **July 2025**: Pentagon agreed to purchase USD 400 million of MP Materials preferred stock, becoming its largest shareholder
- USD 150 million DoD loan to expand heavy rare earth separation at Mountain Pass
- Building end-to-end US rare earth magnet supply chain

### Greenland
- **Kvanefjeld**: Third-largest known REE land deposit (11 million metric tons resources, including 370,000 metric tons of heavy rare earths); stalled by Greenland's 2021 uranium mining ban
- **Tanbreez**: Potentially world's largest rare earth deposit (28.2 million metric tons); under development by New York-based Critical Metals Corp. US Export-Import Bank letter of interest for USD 120 million loan; Trump administration discussed converting a USD 50 million Defense Production Act grant into an equity stake
- US officials lobbied to prevent Tanbreez sale to Chinese buyers (per CNBC, January 2026)

### Other
- Australia overall set to triple mined rare earth oxide supply between 2025-2027
- **Iluka Resources**: Eneabba refinery in Western Australia, backed by AUD 1.25 billion government loan, expected commissioning 2026
- New supply coming online in Malaysia and US during 2025-2026, but insufficient to meet global demand

### KIA Mining Resumption
Per The Irrawaddy, the KIA indicated rare earth mining is set to resume in the Pangwa-Chipwi area, but under KIO-formulated regulations and taxation rather than the previous unregulated Chinese extraction model.

## Key Dynamics

1. **China's vulnerability**: Myanmar supplies the vast majority of China's heavy rare earth feedstock. The KIO seizure demonstrates that China's rare earth dominance has its own supply chain fragility.

2. **Processing bottleneck**: Even if Western nations accessed Myanmar ore, China controls approximately 91% of global rare earth separation and refining. The minerals must be processed somewhere, and non-Chinese capacity is only beginning to emerge (Lynas, MP Materials).

3. **Civil war leverage**: Rare earths have transformed the KIO from a territorial insurgency into a resource gatekeeper with international leverage. The minerals give the KIO bargaining power with China, India, and potentially Western governments.

4. **Green transition paradox**: The minerals needed for EVs and wind turbines are extracted through environmentally devastating processes in a war zone, with no labor or environmental standards.

5. **Sanctions contradiction**: Western sanctions on Myanmar's junta effectively ensure China maintains its monopoly on Myanmar's rare earth output, since no compliant Western supply chain exists.
