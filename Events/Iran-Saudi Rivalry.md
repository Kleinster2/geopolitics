# Iran-Saudi Rivalry

## Overview
The defining regional rivalry of the Middle East, pitting Shia Iran against Sunni Saudi Arabia for regional influence. Fought through proxies in Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and beyond. Recent China-brokered rapprochement (2023) has reduced but not eliminated tensions.

## Foundations of Rivalry

### Ideological
- **Iran**: Revolutionary, anti-status quo, Shia leadership
- **Saudi**: Conservative, status quo, Sunni guardianship
- Competing visions of Islamic order
- Mutual delegitimization

### Geopolitical
- Regional hegemony competition
- Oil market rivals
- Opposing alliance systems
- Zero-sum framing

### Sectarian
- Shia vs. Sunni (simplified but real)
- Mobilization tool
- Not purely religious
- Identity and power intertwined

## Historical Evolution

### 1979: Revolutionary Rupture
- Iranian Revolution
- Khomeini's export of revolution
- Saudi alarm
- Cold War overlay

### 1980s

- Hajj clashes (1987)
- Diplomatic severance
- Containment efforts

### 1990s-2000s
- Periods of détente
- Rafsanjani/Khatami engagement
- 9/11 complications
- Iraq War → Iranian influence growth

### 2010s: Peak Rivalry
- Arab Spring divergence
- Syria (opposite sides)
- Yemen war (2015)
- Diplomatic break (2016)

### 2020s: Rapprochement
- Both exhausted
- China mediation
- 2023 agreement
- Cautious engagement

## Proxy Conflicts

### Yemen
- **Saudi**: Hadi government, coalition
- **Iran**: Houthi support
- **Result**: Stalemate, humanitarian catastrophe
- **Status**: Ceasefire efforts, Saudi exit-seeking

### Syria
- **Saudi**: Initially backed rebels
- **Iran**: Assad regime lifeline
- **Result**: Iran/Russia won
- **Status**: Iran entrenched

### Lebanon
- **Saudi**: Anti-Hezbollah forces
- **Iran**: Hezbollah
- **Result**: Hezbollah dominant
- **Status**: Lebanese collapse

### Iraq
- **Saudi**: Sunni outreach, limited
