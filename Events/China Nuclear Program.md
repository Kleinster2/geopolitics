# China Nuclear Program

## Overview
China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal from a minimal deterrent toward potential parity with the US and Russia. DoD projects 1,000+ warheads by 2030, 1,500 by 2035. This expansion - combined with China's refusal to join arms control frameworks - represents the most significant shift in the nuclear balance since the Cold War.

## Current Arsenal (2025-2026 estimates)

| Category | Estimate | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Total warheads | ~600 | SIPRI June 2025; up from ~200 in 2019 |
| ICBMs | ~350 | DF-5, DF-31, DF-41 |
| SLBMs | ~72 | 6 Jin-class SSBNs |
| Bombers | ~20 H-6 | Nuclear-capable |
| Tactical | Unknown | Possibly developing |

## Projected Growth

DoD 2023 Report projections:

| Year | Warheads |
|------|----------|
| 2025 | ~500 |
| 2030 | 1,000+ |
| 2035 | 1,500 |

If accurate, China approaches parity with US/Russia deployed strategic warheads (~1,550 each under New START).

## Delivery Systems

### ICBMs
- **DF-5B**: Liquid-fueled, silo-based, MIRVed
- **DF-5C**: New "global-covering" ICBM, 12,400+ mile range (unveiled 2025)
- **DF-31AG**: Road-mobile, solid-fuel
- **DF-41**: Road-mobile, MIRVed, 12,000+ km range
- **Silo fields**: ~350 new silos across six fields (three desert in north, three mountainous in east); completion expected before 2028
- China now has more ICBM silos than US has active Minuteman III silos

### SLBMs
- **JL-2**: Current, ~7,000 km range
- **JL-3**: In development, longer range
- **SSBN fleet**: Expanding from 6 to potentially 8+ boats

### Bombers
- **H-6K/N**: Air-launched cruise missiles
- **H-20**: Stealth bomber in development (B-2 equivalent)

### New Capabilities
- **Hypersonic glide vehicles**: DF-ZF tested
- **Fractional Orbital Bombardment**: 2021 test surprised US intelligence
- **MIRV expansion**: Multiple warheads per missile

## Declared Doctrine

### No First Use (NFU)
China's declared policy since 1964:
- Will not use nuclear weapons first
- Will not use against non-nuclear states
- Nuclear weapons for retaliation only

### Minimum Deterrence
Traditional posture:
- Small arsenal sufficient to survive first strike
- Assured retaliation capability
- No arms race participation

## Doctrine in Flux?

### Signs of Shift
- Arsenal expansion beyond "minimum"
- Launch-on-warning capability development
- Silo fields suggest first-strike survivability concern
- Tactical nuclear weapons discussion

### Interpretations

**Continuity View:**
- Still minimum deterrence, just higher floor
- Responding to US missile defense
- Maintaining second-strike credibility

**Shift View:**
- Moving toward launch-on-warning
- May abandon NFU in crisis
- Building toward warfighting capability

### The Ambiguity
China provides no clarity. Strategic ambiguity may be intentional.

## Why Expanding?

### Stated Concerns
- US missile defense expansion
- US conventional precision strike
- Survival of deterrent uncertain

### Strategic Logic
- Match US/Russia as peer
- Taiwan scenarios require credible deterrence
- Bargaining leverage

### Caitlin Talmadge's Warning
Per [[Caitlin Talmadge]]: US conventional operations against China could inadvertently threaten Chinese nuclear deterrent, creating escalation pressure. Entanglement of conventional and nuclear forces is dangerous.

## Arms Control Resistance

### China's Position
- Bilateral framework is US-Russia problem
- China has 1/10th their arsenals - why limit?
- US must reduce drastically first
- Transparency not in China's interest

### Trilateral Talks
- US demanded China inclusion for New START extension
- China refused
- No format exists for three-way negotiation
- Strategic cultures fundamentally different

### The Catch-22
1. US won't extend/replace New START without China path
2. China won't join until US/Russia reduce drastically
3. Russia won't reduce if China unconstrained
4. Framework for three-peer world doesn't exist

## Implications

### For US
- Two-peer nuclear problem (Russia + China)
- Arsenal sizing debates
- Extended deterrence credibility in Asia
- Allies (Japan, South Korea) may reconsider nuclear options

### For Russia
- Nervous about rising China on border
- But aligned against US
- May eventually seek China constraints
- Currently not a priority

### For Arms Control
- Bilateral era over
- No replacement framework
- Transparency impossible to achieve
- New concepts needed

### For Stability
- Tripolar dynamics less stable than bipolar
- Crisis management more complex
- Miscalculation risks multiply
- No communication frameworks

## Taiwan Connection

Nuclear backdrop to Taiwan scenarios:
- China's arsenal deters US intervention calculus
- US extended deterrence credibility tested
- Escalation ladder unclear
- See [[Taiwan]] for conventional dynamics

## Monitoring

### Key Indicators
- Silo construction progress (satellite imagery)
