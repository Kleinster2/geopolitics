# US Withdrawal from International Organizations

## Overview
The Trump 2.0 administration has executed an unprecedented withdrawal of the United States from international organizations. A January 7, 2026 Presidential Memorandum covered 66 organizations (31 UN, 35 non-UN). Combined with earlier targeted exits (WHO, Paris Agreement, UNHRC, UNRWA, UNESCO) and the dismantlement of USAID, at least **72 distinct organizations/agreements** have been exited — the most extensive US retreat from the multilateral system since the post-WWII order was constructed.

## Timeline of Key Actions

| February 4, 2025 | EO 14199: UNHRC withdrawal; UNRWA permanent defunding |

## Administration Rationale

Secretary Rubio stated these institutions were "redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation's sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity." The State Department cited concerns about "DEI mandates," "gender equity campaigns," and "climate orthodoxy."

## The 66-Organization Memorandum (January 7, 2026)

### 31 UN Entities
Includes: UNFCCC (foundational 1992 climate treaty — **first nation ever to withdraw**), UNCTAD, UN Women, UNFPA, UN-Habitat, UN Democracy Fund, REDD+, Peacebuilding Commission, International Law Commission, International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, and 21 others covering economic commissions, children's rights, gender equality, ocean conservation, and population data.

### 35 Non-UN Organizations
Includes: **IPCC** (world's climate science authority), **IRENA** (renewable energy), **IUCN** (conservation), European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, Global Counterterrorism Forum, Venice Commission (constitutional law), Freedom Online Coalition, International IDEA (democracy), ReCAAP (anti-piracy), and 26 others.

## USAID Dismantlement

- 5,341 projects terminated worth **$75 billion** (86% of portfolio)
- Agency reduced from thousands of employees to legally required minimum of **15 staff**
- US foreign aid disbursements: **$68 billion** (2024) → **$32 billion** (2025) — 53% reduction
- FY2026 budget proposal: $31B (47% cut from FY2025); with rescissions, effective new spending of **$9.6B** (84% reduction)

### Legal Battles
- District judges ruled shutdown "likely arbitrary and capricious" and "likely violated the Constitution"
- Supreme Court upheld aid freeze 5-4 (September 2025)
- 4th Circuit stayed lower court ruling, clearing way for continued cuts

## WHO Withdrawal

- Effective **January 22, 2026**
- US contributed ~$261M/year (~18% of WHO funding)
- Unpaid dues dispute: ~$260M for 2024-2025
- China stepped in with **$500M five-year commitment**, becoming WHO's top state donor (per Washington Post, Caixin)
- WHO revised 2026-2027 budget **downward 21%** to $4.2B

## Financial Impact

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| USAID projects terminated | $75B (86% of portfolio) |
| US share of UN regular budget | 22% (~$760M/year) |
| US share of UN peacekeeping | ~26% (~$1.4B/year) |
| Outstanding US UN regular dues (late 2025) | $1.57B (record) |
| Outstanding US peacekeeping dues | ~$2.4B |
| WHO annual contribution lost | ~$261M |

Guterres warned of "imminent financial collapse" by July 2026 in a January 28 letter to ambassadors. UN cash reserves nearly exhausted.

## What the US Is NOT Leaving
UN Security Council, WFP, UNHCR, UNICEF, IAEA, General Assembly — identified as serving essential security or humanitarian functions.

## International Reactions

- **China**: $500M WHO pledge; increased climate commitments; per Lowy Institute, "banks big wins as Trump withdraws from global aid game"
- **Russia**: With China, pushed to cut funding for human rights monitoring mechanisms at UNHRC
- **UN SG Guterres**: US has "legal obligation" to pay assessed contributions under UN Charter
- **Allies**: Concern but limited backfilling; UK, Germany, Canada all cutting their own aid budgets
  - Macron: tariff threats "unacceptable" — "No intimidation or threat will influence us"
  - Starmer: "The use of tariffs against allies is completely wrong"
- **Foreign Policy** (January 2026): described the US as abandoning multilateralism in a "world minus one" scenario
- **Center for American Progress**: adversaries filling the vacuum "not because they are stronger, but because the United States is leaving"
- **Pew Research** (2025): global confidence in US leadership has plummeted

## Comparison: Trump 1.0 vs 2.0

| Dimension | Trump 1.0 | Trump 2.0 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Total exits | ~5-6 targeted | 72+ systematic |
| USAID | Maintained | Effectively dismantled |
| UNFCCC | Not withdrawn | First nation ever to leave |
| Approach | Selective, reversible | Comprehensive, designed to be difficult to reverse |

## Legal Questions

**UNFCCC withdrawal**: Because the Senate ratified the UNFCCC in 1992, can a president unilaterally withdraw? Never decided by the Supreme Court. Constitutional scholars disagree:
- Sen. Whitehouse (D-RI): "Once the Senate has ratified a treaty, only the Senate can withdraw"
- Jean Galbraith (UPenn): "It's an open legal question... never been decided by the U.S. Supreme Court"
- Susan Biniaz (Yale): disagrees on policy but does not consider it illegal under US or international law

The Trump administration faced a record **530 lawsuits in 2025** (per The Fulcrum). The American Journal of International Law published analysis stating the withdrawals contravene US international legal obligations.
