# India-Pakistan Four-Day War (May 2025)

## Overview
The first full-scale military engagement between nuclear-armed states since the 1999 Kargil War, and the first large-scale drone combat between nuclear powers. Triggered by a terrorist attack in Kashmir, the four-day conflict (May 7-10, 2025) featured 114+ aircraft in one of the largest aerial engagements since WWII, 400-500 drones in coordinated waves, and BrahMos/SCALP cruise missile strikes. Ended via DGMO hotline ceasefire.

## The Trigger: Pahalgam Attack (April 22, 2025)

Five gunmen armed with M4 carbines and AK-47s attacked tourists in Baisaran Valley near Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir. 26 civilians killed (24 Hindu tourists, 1 Christian tourist, 1 local Muslim tour operator); 17 injured. Attackers reportedly singled out male Hindus by religion. Deadliest attack on civilians in India since the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

The Resistance Front (TRF), described as a proxy of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, initially claimed responsibility, then retracted on April 26 citing "cyber intrusion." India blamed Pakistan for harboring the groups responsible. In July 2025, the US designated TRF as a terrorist organization (per Al Jazeera).

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| April 22 | Pahalgam attack: 26 killed |
| April 23-24 | India closes border, suspends Indus Waters Treaty; Pakistan closes Wagah, halts trade, suspends overflight rights |
| April 24 | Armed skirmishes along LoC |
| May 3 | Pakistan conducts missile test-launch amid crisis |
| Night of May 6-7 | India launches **Operation Sindoor**: drone and missile strikes against 9 targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Punjab |
| May 7 | Pakistan retaliates: mortar/artillery on Poonch; 400-500 drone waves; **114+ aircraft** aerial engagement (72 IAF vs 42 PAF) |

## The Aerial Battle

Per Modern War Institute (West Point) and PAF press briefing:
- 114+ aircraft involved: 72 IAF vs 42 PAF
- Beyond-visual-range (BVR) engagement at distances up to 100 miles
- Neither side penetrated the other's airspace (per MWI)
- Engagement lasted over one hour
- First significant combat test of Chinese vs Western high-end military hardware

**Indian Rafales with Meteor BVR missiles vs Pakistani J-10Cs with PL-15 missiles** — the first real-world test of these systems against each other.

## Drone Warfare

- India deployed Israeli IAI Harop loitering munitions and Polish Warmate 5.0 drones
- Pakistan launched **400-500 drones** in coordinated waves (per Indian government briefing) — designed to force India to reveal air defense patterns
- Pakistan used Turkish-origin YiHA-III and Asisguard Songar drones, plus indigenous Shahpar-II UAVs
- Pakistan claimed to have shot down 12 Indian Harop kamikaze drones near Karachi and Lahore

## Key Weapons Systems

### Indian

| System | Role |
|--------|------|
| Dassault Rafale (No. 17 Sqn) | Air superiority, SCALP-EG strikes |
| Su-30MKI | BrahMos launch platform |
| Mirage 2000 | Strike aircraft |
| MiG-29 | Air defense / interceptor |
| BrahMos supersonic cruise missile | 15-19 launched, reportedly none intercepted |
| SCALP-EG cruise missile | 10+ launched from Rafales |
| IAI Harop (Israeli) | Loitering munition |
| Meteor BVR missile | Air-to-air (Rafale-mounted) |

### Pakistani

| System | Role |
|--------|------|
| J-10C (Chinese) | Air superiority, BVR engagement |
| JF-17 Block III (Chinese-Pakistani) | Multi-role fighter |
| PL-15 BVR missile (Chinese) | Air-to-air |
| YiHA-III (Turkish-origin) | Attack drone |
| Shahpar-II (indigenous) | Reconnaissance / attack UAV |
| 400-500 drone swarm (mixed) | SIGINT / reconnaissance / saturation |

No confirmed use of US-made F-16s by Pakistan (per MWI).

## Casualties (Disputed)

Casualty figures are heavily contested:

| Claim | Source | Confidence |
|-------|--------|------------|
| 31 Pakistani civilians killed in Indian strikes | Pakistan ISPR | Claimed |
| 100+ militants killed | Indian Defence Minister Singh | Claimed |
| 13 Indian civilians killed, 59 injured in Poonch shelling | Indian official sources | Reported |
| 40-50 Indian soldiers killed along LoC | Pakistan claim | Claimed |
| 50+ dead near LoC (majority of total casualties) | Stimson Center (Christopher Clary) | Assessed |

**Aircraft losses** remain the most contested dimension:
- Pakistan claimed 5 Indian jets shot down (3 Rafales, 1 MiG-29, 1 Su-30)
- India's CDS confirmed loss of "at least one aircraft"
- US Congressional panel report (November 2025): "only three jets flown by India's military were reportedly downed" and "all may not have been Rafale"
- Washington Post identified crash sites consistent with a Rafale, Mirage 2000, and likely MiG-29
- India later claimed (August 9) to have shot down six Pakistani aircraft
- If a Rafale was confirmed lost, it would be the first combat loss of a Rafale globally

Status: **disputed** — no independent verification of exact losses on either side.

## Ceasefire

Pakistan contacted India through the DGMO (Directors General of Military Operations) hotline. Ceasefire effective May 10 at 5:00 PM IST.

**Mediation dispute:**
- Trump announced on social media that the US had "mediated" the ceasefire (VP Vance and Secretary Rubio engaged both sides)
- India firmly rejected the claim. FM Misri: truce resulted from "bilateral discussions, initiated by Pakistan" with no third-party involvement
- PM Modi told Trump directly there was no US mediation (per Al Jazeera, June 18)
- India's Defence Minister Singh called Trump's claim "baseless" (July 29)
- Pakistan's PM Sharif credited Trump alongside Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, UK, UN, and China
- Trump later claimed "We stopped the nuclear war" (June 26)

## Nuclear Dimension

- Both India's CDS and Pakistan's CJCSC stated that "at no time during the conflict" had either nation "considered the use of nuclear weapons" (per East Asia Forum)
- Per Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (November 2025): the conflict tested "the illusion of deterrence" — fighting a limited war between India and Pakistan with "compressed geography, high alert postures, and the logic of full-spectrum deterrence, with virtually no escalatory buffer"
- Pakistan conducted a missile test-launch on May 3 amid the crisis
- India's post-conflict doctrine explicitly states India will "no longer be deterred by nuclear blackmail"

## Strategic Implications

Per MWI (West Point), Stimson Center, Foreign Policy, and Belfer Center:

1. **Drone warfare inflection point** — First large-scale drone combat between nuclear-armed states
2. **Chinese vs Western hardware tested** — J-10C/PL-15 vs Rafale/Meteor in real combat; US Congressional report found Chinese weapons performance validated
3. **BVR combat dominance** — Largest beyond-visual-range engagement in modern history; no close-range dogfighting
4. **Drone swarm saturation** — 400-500 drone waves can force adversary to reveal air defense capabilities
5. **New Indian military doctrine** — PM Modi (May 12): India will "respond to terrorism on its own terms" and "no longer be deterred by nuclear blackmail"
6. **Information warfare** — Both sides conducted competing narratives; per Small Wars Journal, the information domain was as contested as the physical battlespace

## Aftermath

### Indus Waters Treaty
- Remains **suspended** as of early 2026 (per Clingendael, NPR, Al Jazeera)
- India's Home Minister Shah vowed India will "never" restore the treaty
- Pakistan considers water diversion an "act of war"; pursuing matter at UN and ICJ
- Treaty text contains no "suspension" provision; Article XII stipulates modification only by mutual agreement

### Diplomatic Freeze
- Per Chatham House (May 2025): ceasefire "remains shaky, with relations unlikely to return to status quo"
- No formal peace process as of early 2026
- Pakistan recommitted to deepening relationship with China post-ceasefire (per Al Jazeera, May 22)

### Military Doctrinal Changes
- India announced new military doctrine May 12 signaling more aggressive counter-terrorism posture
- India launched "Exercise Cold Start" — drone-centric warfare strategy with eye on both Pakistan and China
- India developing "Bhargavastra" counter-drone system in response to Pakistan's drone swarm tactics
