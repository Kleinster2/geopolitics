# Eurasia Group Top Risks 2026

## Overview
[[Eurasia Group]]'s annual flagship report, released January 6, 2026. Identifies the top 10 political risks for the year ahead, plus "red herrings" (issues that won't be as risky as expected). This year's report is dominated by the transformative impact of Trump's return to power and the acceleration of the [[G-Zero]] world.

## The Top 10 Risks

### 1. The US vs. Itself
**Domestic political revolution under Trump**

The most dangerous development in 2026 is domestic, not international. Trump returns with:
- Consolidated power (unified government, remade judiciary, weakened opposition)
- "Electro state": Musk-led effort to dismantle federal bureaucracy
- Deportation campaigns affecting millions
- Attacks on rule of law and institutional checks
- Potential constitutional crisis

Key quote: "A politically divided nation, already reeling from persistent institutional erosion, will be tested like never before."

### 2. Overpowered
**No one in charge globally**

The [[G-Zero]] world accelerates - no country or alliance willing/able to provide global leadership:
- UN paralyzed across crises
- No coordination on AI governance
- Climate commitments abandoned
- Trade system fragmenting
- "Damage control" becoming primary mode of international relations

This is the structural context for all other risks.

### 3. [[Donroe Doctrine]]
**Trump's Western Hemisphere dominance**

Trump aggressively reasserting US control over the Americas:
- Threatening [[Greenland Crisis|Greenland annexation]]
- [[Panama Canal]] sovereignty disputes
- Forced regime change ([[Venezuela]])
- Pressure on Canada and Mexico
- Revival of [[Monroe Doctrine]] with personal branding

See main note: [[Donroe Doctrine]]

### 4. Europe Under Siege
**Compounding pressures from all directions**

Europe faces simultaneous crises:
- Trump tariffs and security abandonment threats
- Ongoing Ukraine war costs
- Russian hybrid attacks
- Migration pressures
- Economic stagnation
- Political fragmentation (Germany, France weak)
- Potential [[NATO]] fracturing over Greenland

### 5. Russia's Second Front
**Escalating hybrid warfare against Europe**

Putin expands unconventional attacks:
- Sabotage of undersea cables, pipelines
- Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure
- Election interference
- Weaponized migration
- Nuclear signaling

Even if Ukraine conflict winds down, Russian pressure on Europe intensifies.

### 6. State Capitalism with American Characteristics
**Government intervention in US economy**

Trump embracing economic intervention:
- Tariffs as permanent policy tool
- Industrial policy on steroids
- Favoring loyalist businesses
- Punishing perceived enemies
- Blurring line between government and private sector
- Musk's dual role as government official and businessman

Ironic reversal: US adopting practices it criticized in China.

### 7. China's Deflation Trap
**Structural economic downturn**

China faces persistent deflation with limited tools:
- Property sector crisis unresolved
- Consumer confidence collapsed
- Local government debt crisis
- Demographics worsening
- Overcapacity in manufacturing
- Xi unwilling to stimulate consumption
- Export-led growth hitting protectionist walls

### 8. AI Eats Its Users
**Technology outpacing governance**

AI development accelerating without guardrails:
- No international governance framework
- Misinformation/deepfakes undermining trust
- Job displacement accelerating
- Autonomous weapons proliferation
- Tech companies more powerful than governments
- China-US AI competition blocking cooperation

### 9. Zombie USMCA
**North American trade agreement hollowed out**

USMCA (replacing NAFTA) effectively dead:
- Trump imposing tariffs despite agreement
- Canada and Mexico retaliating
- Supply chains disrupting
- Auto sector chaos
- Review mechanism (2026) becoming battleground
- Agreement exists on paper but not in practice

### 10. Water Weapon
**Water scarcity as geopolitical tool**

Water stress becoming acute and weaponized:
- Turkey controlling Euphrates flow
- Central Asian water conflicts
- India-Pakistan Indus tensions
- Climate change reducing supply
- States using water control as leverage
- Agricultural disruption, migration

## Red Herrings
**What WON'T be as risky as expected**

### "Tariff Man" at Large
Tariffs will be less economically damaging than headlines suggest. They're primarily negotiating tools, often exempted or delayed. Markets will adjust.

### Deglobalization
Trade patterns shifting but not collapsing. Regionalization, not deglobalization. "Friendshoring" creates new patterns, not autarky.

### Spheres of Influence
Great power spheres won't stabilize into clear zones. Too much overlap, too many contested spaces, too fluid. Messy competition, not ordered blocs.

### Sell America
Despite political dysfunction, US assets remain attractive. Dollar dominance continues. Capital still flows to US. Alternatives lack depth/trust.

## Garman's Emphasis (January 2026 Interview)
[[Christopher Garman]] highlighted what's notably **absent** from 2026 concerns:
- **US-China crisis** - Seeing "normalization" between superpowers; White House "played too hard," realized China has bargaining power (rare earths), pulled back
- **Trade uncertainty** - Main tariff measures already implemented, entering "equilibrium period"
- **Middle East** - Iran weakened, lower oil spike risk

On Trump: Enters 2026 politically weakened (41-42% approval) but feeling empowered by foreign policy wins. **"When weakened, he doubles down"** - doesn't retreat. Midterm losses likely but won't moderate him.

## Analytical Framework

### FAFO vs. TACO
Eurasia Group's framework for assessing risk:
- **FAFO**: "Fuck around and find out" - reckless action inviting consequences
- **TACO**: Calibrated risk-taking

Trump administration leans heavily FAFO.

### Key Themes
1. US domestic upheaval is the primary risk
2. No global leadership (G-Zero accelerating)
3. Trump reshaping international order through coercion
4. Europe most exposed to multiple simultaneous risks
5. Economic nationalism replacing liberal order
